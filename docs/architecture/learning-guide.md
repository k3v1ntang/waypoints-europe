# Learning Guide

This document outlines learning objectives and developer background for the Waypoints Europe project.

## Developer Profile

- **Background**: Some Python experience using Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot
- **New Technologies**: React, PWA (Progressive Web Apps), TypeScript, Claude Code
- **Learning Goal**: Use Waypoints Europe as a practical learning project for web development
- **Teaching Style**: Clear explanations with appropriate technical vocabulary, properly explained

## Learning Approach

- **Balanced Explanations**: Use technical terms but explain them clearly
- **Technical Depth**: Include enough detail to understand concepts properly
- **Key Concepts**: Highlight and explain important React, PWA, and web development patterns
- **Tutorial Style**: Act as a tutor throughout the coding experience
- **Vocabulary Building**: Introduce technical terms with clear definitions and context

## Learning Targets

### React Fundamentals to Master

- **Components**: Reusable UI building blocks that encapsulate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript logic
- **Hooks**: Special React functions (useState, useEffect, useRef) that add functionality to components
- **JSX**: JavaScript extension syntax that allows writing HTML-like code within JavaScript
- **Event Handling**: How components respond to user interactions (onClick, onChange, etc.)
- **State Management**: How React components store and update data that affects the UI

### PWA Concepts to Understand

- **Service Workers**: JavaScript scripts that run in the background to enable offline functionality
- **Web App Manifest**: JSON configuration file that defines how the app appears when installed
- **Caching Strategies**: Methods for storing resources (images, data, code) for offline access
- **Installation**: How PWAs can be installed on devices like native apps

### Claude Code Development Process

- **AI Pair Programming**: Collaborative development workflow with AI assistance
- **Iterative Development**: Building features incrementally, testing and refining each step
- **Debugging**: Systematic process of identifying and fixing code issues
- **Best Practices**: Industry-standard approaches for modern web development

## Learning Milestones

### Milestone 1: React Fundamentals
- [ ] Understand component architecture and JSX syntax
- [ ] Learn props (component inputs) and state (component data)
- [ ] Master event handling patterns and React's synthetic events
- [ ] Understand component lifecycle and re-rendering concepts

### Milestone 2: Advanced React Patterns
- [ ] Master useEffect hook for side effects and lifecycle management
- [ ] Learn useRef for DOM manipulation and persistent values
- [ ] Understand conditional rendering and list rendering patterns
- [ ] Learn component composition and data flow patterns

### Milestone 3: PWA Architecture
- [ ] Understand Progressive Web App principles and benefits
- [ ] Learn service worker registration and caching strategies
- [ ] Master web app manifest configuration and installation flow
- [ ] Understand offline-first architecture and data synchronization

### Milestone 4: Integration & Production
- [ ] Learn third-party library integration patterns (MapLibre GL JS + OpenFreeMap)
- [ ] Understand performance optimization techniques and best practices
- [ ] Master debugging workflows and browser developer tools
- [ ] Learn deployment strategies and production considerations

### Milestone 5: TypeScript (added July 2026, D5)
- [ ] Understand TypeScript as "type hints enforced at build time" — the closest Python analogue is type hints + mypy, except `tsc` blocks a broken build instead of just warning
- [ ] Learn to read and write basic type annotations (`string`, `number`, union types like `'landmark' | 'culture'`)
- [ ] Understand interfaces/types for shaping data (`Poi`, `City`, `WalkingTour` in `src/data/types.ts`)
- [ ] Learn generics well enough to read (not necessarily write) helpers like `src/data/editStore.ts`'s `withStore<T>`
- [ ] Understand why this codebase converted the data layer before the components (value-order conversion, not converting code about to be rewritten anyway)

## Code Explanation Style

When learning from code examples, look for these teaching patterns:

```javascript
// ❓ CONCEPT: React functional component - a JavaScript function that returns JSX
// 📝 EXPLANATION: Components are reusable pieces of UI that can accept data (props)
const MyComponent = () => {
  // ❓ CONCEPT: useState hook - manages component state (data that can change)
  // 📝 EXPLANATION: Returns current value and setter function, triggers re-render when updated
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return <div>Count: {count}</div>
}
```

## Learning Checkpoints

After implementing each major feature, reflect on:
- Technical concepts demonstrated and their definitions
- How the implementation follows React/PWA best practices
- The role this feature plays in the overall application architecture
- Next technical concepts we'll encounter and their importance

## Modern Development Learning Goals

- **Learn current industry standards**, not outdated practices
- **Use modern tooling and approaches** that are relevant in 2025
- **Understand why** certain older methods are deprecated
- **Build skills** that transfer to professional development environments

## Documentation Priority Order

1. **Official documentation** (React, Vite, MapLibre, TypeScript, PWA specs)
2. **Current community best practices** (GitHub discussions, recent articles)
3. **Latest stable releases** and changelogs
4. **Modern alternatives** to older approaches

## Example Learning Flow

### Before Suggesting Implementation
1. ✅ RESEARCH: Check if this is current best practice
2. ✅ DISCOVER: Identify the modern approach
3. ✅ RECOMMEND: Suggest with explanation of why it's preferred
4. ✅ EXPLAIN: Why older methods are legacy

### Example
```
Before suggesting: "Use componentDidMount for lifecycle"
✅ RESEARCH: Check if this is current best practice
✅ DISCOVER: useEffect is the modern hook-based approach
✅ RECOMMEND: useEffect with proper explanation of why it's preferred
✅ EXPLAIN: Why componentDidMount is legacy (class-based components)
```
