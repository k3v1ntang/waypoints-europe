## Walking Tour POIs

### Rådhuspladsen (City Hall Square)
- **Description**: Copenhagen's historic city hall and central square, a major gathering place and tourist hub in the heart of the city. Dominated by the tower of the City Hall.
- **History**: For 700 years, Copenhagen was contained within its city walls, and this square was its fortified west end. By the mid-1800s, 140,000 people were packed inside. The overcrowding led to hygiene problems and a cholera outbreak that killed 5,000. The formidable town walls survive today only in echoes—a circular series of roads and remnants of moats, which are now people-friendly city lakes. Rådhuspladsen is where the city gathers to celebrate.
- **Tips**: Rick Steves p.77 - climb the tower, check the clock opposite to info desk. Stand 50 yards in front of City Hall and turn clockwise. Old Hans Christian Andersen sits to the right of City Hall.

### Tivoli Gardens
- **Description**: One of the world's oldest operating amusement parks. Features beautiful gardens, vintage rides, concerts, and seasonal decorations that inspired Walt Disney.
- **History**: Tivoli Gardens was founded in 1843 when magazine publisher Georg Carstensen convinced the king to build a pleasure garden outside the walls of crowded Copenhagen. The king believed happy people would care less about fighting for democracy. Tivoli became Europe's first great public amusement park and later inspired Walt Disney when he visited in the 1950s.

### Vesterbrogade (Weather Girls)
- **Description**: The big, broad boulevard is **Vesterbrogade** ("Western Way"), which led to the western gate of the medieval city (behind you, where the pedestrian boulevard begins). Here, in the traffic hub of this huge city, you'll notice...not many cars. Throughout Copenhagen, you'll see how the mayor's mantra, **"We will build a city not for cars but for people"**—along with tax-and-regulation policies that encourage small electric cars and use of public transit and bikes—is shaping the city.
- **History**: Vesterbrogade marks the western gateway to medieval Copenhagen. The street showcases Copenhagen's modern urban planning philosophy prioritizing pedestrians, cyclists, and public transit over cars. The weather girls sculpture has become a beloved city landmark.
- **Tips**: The golden **weather girls** (on the corner, high above Vesterbrogade) indicate the weather: on a bike (fair weather) or with an umbrella (foul).

> Down Vesterbrogade towers the **Radisson Blu Royal Hotel** (with its SAS sign), once Copenhagen's only skyscraper. When it was built in 1960, Copenhageners took one look and decided—that's enough of a skyline. Notice there are no other buildings taller than the five-story limit in the old center.
>
>
> As you spin farther right, **three fast-food joints** stand at the entry to the Strøget, Copenhagen's grand pedestrian boulevard—where we're heading next.
> 
> Just beyond that and the Art Deco-style Palace Hotel (with a tower to serve as a sister to the City Hall) is the **Lur Blowers sculpture**, which honors the earliest warrior Danes. The *lur* is a curvy, trombone-sounding horn perhaps used to call soldiers to battle or to accompany pagan religious processions.
> 
> Down the street, on the left side of City Hall, the **Rainbow Square** is a reminder that in 1989 Denmark was the first country in the world to give legal rights to same-sex partnerships and has long been a leader in gay rights.
> 
> Now head down the pedestrian boulevard (pickpocket alert).

### Strøget
- **Description**: Europe's first fully pedestrianized street, now Copenhagen's main shopping boulevard from City Hall to Nyhavn.
- **History**: Finished in 1962, Copenhagen's experimental, tremendously successful, and much-copied pedestrian shopping mall is a string of lively streets and squares that bunny-hop through the old town from City Hall to the Nyhavn quarter, a 20-minute stroll. This was Europe's first great public pedestrian street.
- **Tips**: Great for shopping and people watching

> Walk one block (at Kattesundet), make a side trip three blocks left, straight into Copenhagen's colorful university district (Latin Quarter).

### St. Peter's Church (Sankt Petri Kirke)
- **Description**: Historic brick church that served Copenhagen's German merchant community, still holding services in German today. Features a distinctive 17th-century brick funerary chapel at ground level.
- **History**: The ground-floor funerary chapel, unusual for being built at soil level rather than below ground, houses elaborate German tombs that showcase the wealth and influence of these merchants.
- **Tips**: Church and burial chapels open Thu-Sat 11:00-15:00. Pass funky shops in the surrounding area while exploring.

### Cathedral of Our Lady (Vor Frue Kirke)
- **Description**: Copenhagen's main cathedral with Neoclassical Greek temple facade and Thorvaldsen's masterpiece sculptures of the 12 apostles.
- **History**: The cathedral celebrates Denmark's break from the Roman Catholic Church to become Lutheran in **1536**. King Christian III presided over the council meeting when they decided to break away from Rome. Because of the reforms of 1536, there's **no Mary** in the Cathedral of Our Lady. The church burned down in the 1807 British bombardment during the Napoleonic Wars. Rebuilt in Neoclassical style, the cathedral's facade looks like a Greek temple. The interior features the 12 apostles clad in classical robes—masterpieces by the great Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen. They lead to a statue of the Risen Christ, standing where Zeus would have been.
- **Tips**: Free entry - see Thorvaldsen's apostle sculptures

### Gammeltorv
- **Description**: **Gammeltorv** ("Old Square"), the town center, features the **Fountain of Charity (*Caritas*)** (early 1600s), which provided drinking water to locals since the early 1600s. Featuring a pregnant woman squirting water from her breasts next to a boy urinating, this was deemed too racy for people of the Victorian Age.
- **History**: As Copenhagen's original town center, Gammeltorv has been a gathering place for centuries. The Fountain of Charity from the early 1600s served as a vital source of drinking water for residents. The fountain's provocative design, featuring fertility imagery, was considered scandalous during the Victorian era but reflects the more open attitudes of 17th-century Denmark.
- **Tips**: Historic square perfect for people-watching and understanding medieval Copenhagen's layout.

### Nytorv
- **Description**: While **Gammeltorv** was the place of happiness and merriment, **Nytorv** ("New Square") was a place of severity and judgment. The square is **Neoclassical** (built mostly after the **1807 British bombardment**). Look down at the pavement and read the plaque: **"Here stood the town's *Kag* (whipping post) until 1780."**
- **History**: In contrast to its festive neighbor Gammeltorv, Nytorv served as Copenhagen's place of justice and punishment. The town's whipping post stood here until 1780, where public punishments were carried out. The square was rebuilt in Neoclassical style after the devastating 1807 British bombardment during the Napoleonic Wars.
- **Tips**: Look for the pavement plaque marking where the whipping post once stood - a reminder of harsh medieval justice.

### Gråbrødretorv
- **Description**: Surrounded by fine old buildings, this leafy and beer-stained **"Grey Friars' Square"**—a monastic square until the Reformation made it a people's square—is popular for an outdoor meal or drink in the summer.
- **History**: Named after the Greyfriars (Franciscan monks) who once had a monastery here, Gråbrødretorv transformed from a monastic square into a public space after the Protestant Reformation. The square retains its medieval charm with cobblestones and historic buildings, now housing cafes and restaurants instead of monks.
- **Tips**: Popular spot for outdoor dining and drinks in summer - one of Copenhagen's most atmospheric squares with beer-friendly ambiance.

- **History**: Designed by Hans van Steenwinckel the Younger, the Round Tower is part of the Trinitatis Complex which includes a chapel and the first facilities of the Copenhagen University Library founded in 1482.

> 
> Climb up the stairs by the fountain and continue along the top of the rampart about five minutes to reach the harborfront site of the overrated, overfondled, and overphotographed symbol of Copenhagen, *Den Lille Havfrue*.

### The Little Mermaid
- **Description**: Bronze statue inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale, created by sculptor Edvard Eriksen in 1913. Despite being smaller than expected, it's one of Copenhagen's most famous symbols.
- **History**: Gift to Copenhagen in 1909 from brewing magnate Carl Jacobsen. Inspired by a ballet performance of Andersen's story, Jacobsen hired Eriksen to immortalize the mermaid. Eriksen used his wife Eline as the model. The statue sat unappreciated for 40 years until Danny Kaye sang "Wonderful Copenhagen" in the 1952 movie "Hans Christian Andersen", and the tourist board decided to use the mermaid as a marketing symbol.
- **Tips**: Small but iconic statue - best photos from the rocks nearby
