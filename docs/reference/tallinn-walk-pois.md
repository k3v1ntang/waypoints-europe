### 1 Fat Margaret Tower (Paks Margareeta)
- **Description**: Massive 16th-century cannon tower guarding Tallinn's harbor entrance. Now houses the Estonian Maritime Museum. Named for its thick defensive walls built to withstand cannon fire.
- **History**: This tower guarded the entry gate of the town in medieval times when the sea came much closer. Built during Hanseatic times when Sweden took Estonia from the German Teutonic Knights (16th century plaque above gate). Besides being a defensive outpost, the tower was made big to intimidate anyone coming to town from the harbor. Named for its thick walls necessary to defend against 16th-century cannon balls.
- **Tips**: Starting point for the Tallinn Walk. Look for the 16th-century plaque above the gate. Houses Estonian Maritime Museum. The tower's impressive size was meant to both defend and intimidate approaching visitors. Rick Steves walk description.

- **Description**: Tallinn's main medieval merchants' street leading from harbor to town, lined with historic warehouses featuring gables and cranes. Notable landmarks include the "Three Sisters" merchant buildings and St. Olav's Church with its distinctive spire.

The street showcases the wealth of German merchants during the 15th-16th century golden age. The Three Sisters buildings are textbook examples of merchant home/warehouse/office from Hanseatic times. St. Olav's Church once had the world's tallest spire (1492) which helped ships navigate and served as a lightning rod.
- **Tips**: Walk from Fat Margaret Tower uphill into town. Look for Three Sisters buildings and ornate carved doors showing merchant wealth. St. Olav's Church tower offers great views (234 stairs, €5, April-Oct only). Church is free, daily 10:00-18:00.

The Brotherhood was for single German men (bachelors deployed first in fires/battles). When a member married locally, he joined the Great Guild and gained economic/political status. Named after St. Maurice, an early Christian soldier-martyr beheaded in the 3rd century for refusing to honor Roman gods.

- **History**: Retains its 14th-century layout with creaky wooden floors and lovingly crafted details. The pulpit features the "poor man's Bible" - painted scenes to inspire the illiterate. The old Tallinn flag (red-and-white Danish) recalls 13th-century Danish rule - "Tallinn" means "Danish Town." Danes sold the city to German Teutonic Knights, who lost it to Swedes, who lost it to Russians. Most windows date from the 1990s.

### 8 City Walls and Gardens
- **Description**: View terrace known as Danish King's Garden with medieval city walls. Tallinn's walls once had 46 towers, 26 still standing. Includes the Kiek in de Kök tower with steep staircases and medieval exhibits.
- **History**: Gifted to the lower town by the Danish King in 1311. According to legend, during a losing battle here, a white cross fell from heaven into a pool of blood, inspiring the Danes to victory - hence Denmark's flag design (white cross on red). The imposing walls mark the official boundary between lower and upper towns. Kiek in de Kök means "Peek in the Kitchen" in Low German - guards could literally see into townspeople's homes from this tower.

### 9 Alexander Nevsky Cathedral
- **Description**: Striking Russian Orthodox cathedral built in 1900 during the Russian Empire period. Features distinctive onion domes and ornate Russian Orthodox architecture, representing a period many Estonians would prefer to forget.
- **History**: Built in 1900 on Toompea (seat of Estonian government) during the period of late 19th-century Russification under Czar Alexander III. Named after Russian warrior prince Alexander Nevsky who defeated German crusaders in 1242. The cathedral's prominent position on Toompea hill was deliberately chosen to assert Russian dominance, facing the traditional Estonian seat of power over the supposed grave of legendary Estonian hero Kalevipoeg. Russians tore down a statue of Martin Luther to make room. After Estonian independence in 1991, the cathedral remains controversial as a symbol of Russian occupation, though it's now recognized as an important architectural monument.
- **Tips**: Free entry, daily 8:00-18:00 (Sat until 19:00). Services daily at 8:30 and 17:00 - OK to visit discreetly. Exquisitely renovated interior with glittering icons, iconostasis screen, no pews (worshippers stand), heavy incense creating mystical atmosphere. Buy candles to light a prayer at desk by door.

### 10 Toompea Castle (Toompea Loss)
- **Description**: Pink palace with 18th-century Russian addition onto medieval castle, now the Estonian Parliament (Riigikogu) building. Flies the Estonian flag with three lions and oak leaves symbolizing strength and stubbornness.
- **History**: The pink palace is an 18th-century Russian addition to the medieval Toompea Castle. Today houses the Estonian Parliament flying the flag of both the first (1918-1940) and second (1991-present) Estonian republics. The Estonian seal shows three lions for three great battles and oak leaves for strength and stubbornness. Ancient pagan Estonians believed spirits lived in oak trees and would walk through oak forests to toughen up. Estonian cemeteries are still in forests, keeping some pagan sensibilities that spirits of the departed live in trees.
- **Tips**: Seat of Estonian government on Toompea hill. The pink palace faces Alexander Nevsky Cathedral across the square. Look for the Estonian flag and seal. Access Tall Hermann Tower through the park gate to the left of the palace. Rick Steves walk stop ⑪.

### 11 Tall Hermann Tower (Pikk Hermann)
- **Description**: Tallest tower of Toompea Castle wall and powerful symbol of Estonian independence. For 50 years during Soviet occupation, the red Soviet flag flew here. Now flies the Estonian blue, black, and white flag.
- **History**: Built in 1371, obtained current height (45.6m) and shape in late 15th century. The flag on top at 95 meters above sea level is one of the main symbols of national government. While Estonian flags were hidden in cellars during 50 years of Soviet occupation, the Soviet flag flew from Tall Hermann. As the USSR unraveled, Estonians defiantly replaced the red Soviet flag with their own blue, black, and white flag - a powerful moment of national rebirth.
- **Tips**: Located at the south-western corner of Toompea Castle. A narrow stone staircase of 215 steps leads to the top. Access through the gate in the park to the left of the pink palace. Symbol of Estonian independence and resilience. Rick Steves walk stop ⑫.

### 12 Dome Church (Toomkirik)
- **Description**: St. Mary's Cathedral, officially Lutheran but in a country that's the least religious in the EU. Perfect example of simple Northern European Gothic built 13th century during Danish rule, rebuilt after 1684 fire.
- **History**: Built in the 13th century during Danish rule, then rebuilt after a 1684 fire. Once the church of Tallinn's wealthy German-speaking aristocracy, littered with over 100 coats of arms carved by local masters as memorials to the deceased with German tributes.
