### 2 Senate Square (Senaatintori)
- **Description**: A unique architectural square featuring Helsinki Cathedral and other neoclassical buildings. The finest Neoclassical square in Europe, designed by Carl Ludvig Engel after the 1808 fire. Features the Lutheran Cathedral with its grand staircase, statue of Czar Alexander II, and symmetrical government buildings.
- **History**: After Finland became a grand duchy of the Russian Empire, the czar sent German architect Carl Ludvig Engel (who had lived in St. Petersburg) to redesign the square in Neoclassical style.

Czar Alexander II statue honors the czar who freed serfs and gave Finland more autonomy in 1863.

Blue-gray stone building from 1757 (Helsinki City Museum) is one of few pre-Russian buildings surviving. National Library has world's finest Slavic book collection.
