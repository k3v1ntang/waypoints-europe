# Gamla Stan Walk

**Duration:** ~1-2 hours
**Start:** Slottsbacken (Palace Hill esplanade)
**End:** Slussen Bridge / Golden Bridge

Gamla Stan, Stockholm's historic island Old Town, is charming, photogenic, and full of antique shops, street lanterns, painted ceilings, and tourists. Until the 1600s, all of Stockholm fit in Gamla Stan. Stockholm traded with other northern ports such as Amsterdam, Lübeck, and Tallinn. German culture influenced art, building styles, and even the language, turning Old Norse into modern Swedish. With its narrow alleys and stairways, Gamla Stan mixes poorly with cars and modern economies. Today, it's been given over to the Royal Palace and to the tourists, who throng Gamla Stan's main drag, Västerlånggatan, seemingly unaware that most of Stockholm's best attractions are elsewhere. While you could just happily wander, this quick walk gives meaning to Stockholm's Old Town.

*Our walk begins along the harborfront. Start at the base of Slottsbacken (the Palace Hill esplanade) leading up to the...*

## 1. Royal Palace

Along the water, check out the **statue of King Gustav III** gazing at the palace, which was built in the 1700s on the site of Stockholm's first castle (for more about the palace, see "Sights in Stockholm," later). Gustav transformed Stockholm from a dowdy Scandinavian port into a sophisticated European capital, modeled on French culture. Gustav loved the arts, and he founded the Royal Dramatic Theater and the Royal Opera in Stockholm. Ironically, he was assassinated by a discontented nobleman, who shot Gustav in the back at a masquerade ball at the Royal Opera House in 1792 (inspiring Verdi's opera *Un Ballo in Maschera*).

Walk up the broad, cobbled boulevard alongside the palace to the crest of the hill. Stop, look back, and scan the harbor. The grand building across the water is the National Museum. Beyond that, in the distance, is the fine row of buildings on Strandvägen street. Until the 1850s, this area was home to peasant shacks, but as Stockholm entered its grand stage, it was cleaned up and replaced by fine apartments, including some of the city's smartest addresses. That's the home of embassy row. A blocky gray TV tower stands tall in the distance. Turn to the palace facade on your left (finished in 1754, replacing one that burned in 1697). The niches are filled with Swedish bigwigs (literally) from the mid-18th century.

The **equestrian statue** is of King Charles XIV John (r. 1818-44), the first of the Bernadottes who rule to this day. To his immediate left is the grand entry to the Royal Palace and passage to the courtyard where the changing of the guard takes place. Step inside the passage for a quick peek. Flanking you under the grand dome is the dynamic duo of old-regime power: on the right the **royal chapel** (free, royally Baroque, and worth a look) and on the left the **Hall of State** (you can step inside to the turnstile to see its 1650 throne, flanked by statues of important kings, under the "Swedish summer sky" ceiling painted in 2010 for the crown princess's wedding).

*Head back outside and continue up Slottsbacken.*

## 2. Obelisk (Royal Palace to Köpmangatan)

As you crest the hill, you're facing the **obelisk** that honors Stockholm's merchant class for its support in a 1788 war against Russia.

Behind the obelisk stands Storkyrkan, Stockholm's Gothic cathedral (which we'll visit later on this walk). From this angle you can see its Baroque facade, which was added to better match the newer palace. Opposite the palace is the Finnish church (Finska Kyrkan, the deep orange building), which originated as the royal tennis hall. When the Protestant Reformation hit in 1527, church services could at last be said in the people's languages rather than Latin. Suddenly, each merchant community needed its own church. Finns worshipped here, the Germans built their own church (coming up on this walk), and the Swedes got the cathedral.

Stroll up the lane to the right of the Finnish church into the shady churchyard, where you'll find the fist-sized **Iron Boy**, the tiniest public statue (out of about 600) in Stockholm. Swedish grannies knit caps for him in the winter. Local legend says the statue honors the orphans who had to transfer cargo from sea ships to lake ships before Stockholm's locks were built. Some people rub his head for good luck (which the orphans didn't have). Others, perhaps needy when it comes to this gift, rub his head for wisdom. The artist says it's simply a portrait of himself as a child, sitting on his bed and gazing at the moon. (Local dogs just think it's purpose-built as a great little spot to take a pee.)

*Exit through either of the churchyard gates, turn left onto Trädgårdsgatan, then bear right with the lane to reach...*

## 3. Iron Boy Statue

See description above - Iron Boy is located in the Finnish church courtyard.

## 4. St. George Statue (Köpmangatan)

Take a moment to explore this street from one end to the other. With its cobbles and traditional pastel facades, this is a quintessential Gamla Stan lane—and one of the oldest in town. The mellow yellow houses are predominantly from the 18th century; the reddish facades are mostly 17th century. Once merchants' homes, today these are popular with antique dealers and refined specialty shops. Back when there was comfort living within a city's walls, Gamla Stan streets like this were densely populated.

Head left to Köpmantorget square, highlighted by the breathtaking **statue of St. George** slaying the dragon, with a maiden representing Stockholm (about 10 steps to the right) looking on with thanks and admiration. Shops around here are noted for their Swedish handicrafts.

*Return uphill on the same lane to old Stockholm's main square...*

## 5. Stortorget

Colorful old buildings topped with gables line this square—Stockholm's oldest. In 1400, this was the heart of medieval Stockholm (pop. 6,000). Here at the town well, many tangled lanes intersected, making it the natural center for trading. Today Stortorget is home to lots of tourists—including a steady storm of cruise groups following their guides' paddle on four-hour blitz tours of the city (typically 250 ships call here between June and September). The square also hosts concerts, occasional demonstrators, and a Christmas market in winter.

The grand building on the right is the old stock exchange, now home to the noble **Nobel Prize Museum** (described later under "Sights in Stockholm"). On the immediate left, offering the cheapest and best lunch around, is the recommended Grillska Huset. If you peek into the adjacent bakery, you'll get a fine look at the richly decorated ceilings characteristic of Gamla Stan in the 17th century—the exotic flowers and animals implied that the people who lived or worked here were worldly. You'll also spy some tempting marzipan cakes (a local favorite) and *kanelbullar* (cinnamon buns). There's a cheap sandwich counter in the back and lots of picnic benches in the square.

The town well is still a popular meeting point. This square long held the town's pillory. Scan the fine old facades. The site of the **Stockholm Bloodbath** of 1520, this square has a notorious history. During a Danish power grab, many of Stockholm's movers and shakers who had challenged Danish rule—Swedish aristocracy, leading merchants, and priests—were rounded up, brought here, and beheaded. Rivers of blood were said to have flowed through the streets. Legend holds that the 80 or so gray stones in the fine red facade across the square symbolize the victims. (One victim's son escaped, went into hiding, and resurfaced to lead a Swedish revolt against the Danish rulers. Three years later, the Swedes elected that rebel, Gustav Vasa, as their first king. He went on to usher in a great period in the country's history—the Swedish Renaissance.)

*At the far end of the square (under the finest gables), turn right and follow Trångsund toward the...*

## 6. Cathedral (Storkyrkan)

Just before the painted stonework church, you'll see my personal phone booth (Rikstelefon) and the gate to the churchyard—guarded by statues of Caution and Hope. This church is Stockholm's oldest, from the 14th century.

**Cost and Hours:** 85 SEK, daily 9:00-18:00; see signs for special events (the church is busy with tours and services in summer).

**Visiting the Cathedral:** When buying your ticket, pick up the free, worthwhile English-language flier. Exploring the historic cathedral's interior (which has plenty of English descriptions posted), you'll find many styles, ranging from medieval to modern. The front of the nave is paved with centuries-old **tombstones**. The tombstone of the Swedish reformer Olaus Petri is appropriately simple and appropriately located—directly under the finely carved and gilded pulpit on the left side of the nave. A witness to the Stockholm Bloodbath, Petri was nearly executed himself. He went on to befriend Gustav Vasa and guide him in Lutheranizing Sweden (and turning this cathedral from Catholic to Protestant).

Opposite the pulpit, find the **bronze plaque** in the pillar. It recalls the 1925 Swedish-led ecumenical meeting of Christian leaders that encouraged all churches to renew their efforts on behalf of peace and justice, especially given the horrific toll of World War I.

Next, the best seats in the house: the carved wood **royal boxes** under gilded canopies, dating from 1684. This has been a royal wedding church throughout the ages. It was here, in June 2010, that Crown Princess Victoria, heir to the throne, married Daniel Westling (her personal trainer) with much pomp and ceremony.

The fine 17th-century **altar** is made of silver and ebony. Above it, the silver Christ stands like a conquering general evoking the 1650s, an era of Swedish military might.

Left of the altar is a wondrous 1489 statue, carved from oak and elk horn, of **St. George** slaying the dragon (we saw a copy of it outside a few minutes ago). To some, this symbolizes the Swedes overcoming the evil Danes (commemorating a military victory in 1471). In a broader sense, it's an inspiration to take up the struggle against even non-Danish evil. Regardless, it must be the gnarliest dragon's head in all of Europe.

Return to the back of the church to find the exit. Before leaving, to the left of the door, notice the **painting** that depicts Stockholm in the early 1500s, showing a walled city filling today's Gamla Stan. It's a 1630 copy of the 1535 original. This church, with its black spire, dominated the town back then. The strange sun and sky predicted big changes in Sweden—and as a matter of fact, that's what happened. Gustav Vasa brought on huge reforms in religion and beyond. (A handy and free WC is on the right, up two steps.) On the back wall notice an unbroken list of pastors stretching back to 1524 (and finally, in 1990, a woman).

Heading outside, you'll emerge into the kid-friendly churchyard, which was once the cemetery.

*With your back to the church's front door, go right. At the next corner, turn left (on Storkyrkobrinken), then left again on...*

## 7. Prästgatan & Rune Stone

Enjoy a quiet wander up this peaceful 15th-century "Priests' Lane." While this lane is sleepy, you'll notice Västerlånggatan, the touristy main drag that parallels it one block over. (While we'll skip it now, you can walk back up it from the end point of this walk.) As you stroll Prästgatan, look for bits of its past: hoists poking out horizontally from gables (merchants used these with pulleys to lift goods into their attics), tie bolts (iron bars necessary to bind the timber beams of tall buildings together), small coal or wood hatches (for fuel delivery back in the good old days), and flaming gold phoenixes under red-crown medallions (telling firefighters which houses paid insurance and could be saved in case of fire—for example, #46). Like other Scandinavian cities, Stockholm was plagued by fire until it was finally decreed that only stone, stucco, and brick construction (like you see here) would be allowed in the town center.

After a few blocks (at Kåkbrinken), a cannon barrel on the corner (look down) guards a Viking-age **rune stone**. In case you can't read the old Nordic script, it says: "Torsten and Frogun erected this stone in memory of their son."

*Continue one block farther down Prästgatan to Tyska Brinken and turn left. Look up to see the powerful brick steeple of the...*

## 8. German Church (Tyska Kyrkan)

The church's carillon has played four times a day since 1666. Think of the days when German merchants worked here. Today, Germans come to Sweden not to run the economy, but to enjoy its pristine nature (which is progressively harder to find in their own crowded homeland). Sweden formally became a Lutheran country even before the northern part of Germany—making this the very first German Lutheran church (Mon-Sat 10:30-16:30, Sun 14:30-16:30).

*Wander through the churchyard and out the back. Exit right onto Svartmangatan and follow it to the right, ending at an iron railing overlooking Österlånggatan.*

---

## 9. Viewpoint

From this perch, survey the street below to the left and right. Notice how it curves. This marks the old shoreline. Notice how the lane (to the right) leads to the water. In medieval times, piers stretched out like fingers into the harbor. Gradually, as land was reclaimed and developed, these piers were extended, becoming lanes leading to piers ever farther away.

*Walk right to Österlånggatan, and continue on to...*

---

## 10. Järntorget

A customs square in medieval times, this was the home of Sweden's first bank back in 1680 (the yellow building with the bars on the windows). The Co-op Nära supermarket on this square offers picnic fixings. From here, Västerlånggatan—the touristy eating, shopping, and commercial pedestrian mall of Gamla Stan—leads back across the island. You'll be there in a minute, but first let's finish this walk.

*Continue from the square (opposite where you entered) down Järntorgsgatan; you'll emerge at a busy intersection and bridge. It may be a bit of a mess because of an enormous redevelopment project that will eventually turn this area into a green people-zone.*

---

## 11. Bridge Overlooking Slussen

This area is called Slussen, named for the locks between the salt water of the Baltic Sea (to your left) and the fresh water of huge **Lake Mälaren** (to your right). Stockholm exists because this is where Lake Mälaren meets the sea. Traders would sail their goods from far inland to this point, where they'd meet merchants who would ship the goods south to Europe. In the 13th century, the new kingdom of Sweden needed revenue and began levying duty taxes on all the iron, copper, and furs shipped through here.

From here, you may notice a current in the water, indicating that the weir has been lowered and water is spilling from Lake Mälaren (about two feet above sea level) into the sea. Today, the locks are nicknamed "the divorce lock" because this is where captains and first mates learn to communicate under pressure and in the public eye.

*Continue to the left, cross over to the water, and then walk right, halfway up the...*

## 12. "Golden Bridge"

Enjoy the view from this bridge (made in China and shipped here). Scan the view from right to left.

Opposite Gamla Stan is the **Södermalm** neighborhood—youthful, artsy, and casual. Moored in the harbor are cruise ships, which bring thousands of visitors into town each day during high season. Many of these boats are bound for Finland and other Baltic ports. The towering white syringe is the Gröna Lund amusement park's free-fall ride. Around that park, on the island called Djurgården, are three of Stockholm's top sights: Skansen, the Nordic Museum, and the Vasa Museum. Farther left is the three-masted *Af Chapman* sailing ship, which has been moored here and serving as a youth hostel for 60 years. Next, in the near foreground, is the ferry that zips from here to Gröna Lund and those big attractions on Djurgården.

*Our walk is finished, but feel free to linger longer in Gamla Stan—day or night, it's a lively place. You can backtrack along Västerlånggatan, the main commercial drag, visit one of Gamla Stan's sights (described later, under "Sights in Stockholm"), or hop on the ferry to Djurgården for more sightseeing.*

**Another option is to walk 15 minutes to Kungsträdgården, the starting point of my self-guided Modern City Walk (see next).**
