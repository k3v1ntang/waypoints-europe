# Tallinn Walk

**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Start:** Fat Margaret Tower (Paks Margareeta)
**End:** Hotel Viru & Viru Keskus Mall

This self-guided walk explores the lower and upper towns of Tallinn. The city once consisted of two feuding medieval towns separated by a wall. Toompea—the upper town on a hill—was the seat of government for Estonia. The lower town was an autonomous Hanseatic trading center filled with German, Danish, and Swedish merchants who hired Estonians to do their menial labor. Many of the Old Town's buildings are truly old, dating from the boom times of the 15th and 16th centuries. Decrepit before the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, the Old Town has been entirely revitalized.

Two steep, narrow streets—the "Long Leg" and the "Short Leg"—connect the upper and the lower towns. This walk goes up the short leg and down the long leg. Allow about two hours for the entire walk (not counting time to enter museums along the way).

## LOWER TOWN

### ① Fat Margaret Tower (Paks Margareeta)

This tower guarded the entry gate of the town in medieval times (the sea once came much closer than it does today). Besides being a defensive outpost, the tower was made big just to intimidate anyone coming to town from the harbor. The plaque above the gate dates from the 16th century, during Hanseatic times, when Sweden took Estonia from the German Teutonic Knights. The origin of the tower's name is a bit of a mystery. My favorite story is that it was named for its thick walls, which were necessary to defend against the military technology of the 16th century—cannon balls.

*Once through the gate, head up Tallinn's main drag...*

### ② Pikk Street

Literally "Long Street," the medieval merchants' main drag leads from the harbor up into town. It's lined with interesting and historic buildings. Many were warehouses, complete with cranes with cranes on the gables. Strolling here, you'll feel the economic power of those early German trading days.

One short block up the street on the right, the buildings nicknamed **"Three Sisters"** are textbook examples of a merchant home/warehouse/office from the 15th-century Hanseatic golden age. The elaborately carved door near the uphill corner evokes the wealth of Tallinn's merchant class—such detailed decoration would have come with a high price tag. While the local saying is "Tallinn was built on salt," the Old Town was essentially built with Hanseatic money—profits from salt as well as furs, fish, weapons, and spices.

Your next stop, after another, longer block, is marked by its green pointy spire. The Gothic **St. Olav's Church** (Oleviste Kirik, a Baptist church today) is notable for what was once the tallest spire in the land. That high spire helped approaching ships set their course and was also an effective lightning rod. Unfortunately, lightning strikes caused the church to burn to the ground three times. If the name doesn't tip you off that this was once a Lutheran church, then the stark, whitewashed interior will. The empty niches above the nave and elsewhere are a reminder that, until the Reformation came to town, this was once a highly ornamented Catholic church. Climbing 234 stairs up the tower (actually to the landing about halfway up) rewards you with a great view. You can enter both the church and the tower around the back side (church—free, daily 10:00-18:00; tower—€5, open April-Oct only).

While tourists see only a peaceful scene today, older locals strolling this street are reminded of dark times under Moscow's rule. The KGB used the tower at St. Olav's Church to block Finnish TV signals. The once-handsome building at Pikk #59 (the second house after the church, on the right) was, before 1991, part of the local KGB headquarters. You can view some of the former headquarters by visiting the **KGB Prison Cells** exhibit (described later, under "Sights in Tallinn"). "Creative" interrogation methods were used here. Locals knew well that the road of suffering started here, as Tallinn's troublemakers were sent to Siberian gulags. The ministry building was called the "tallest" building in town (because "when you're in the basement, you can already see Siberia"). Notice the bricked-up windows at street level and the commemorative plaque (in Estonian).

*If you see a rush of tourists with their luggage washing up the street—a Helsinki ferry has just landed. Continue walking up Pikk. Look out for a naked woman hugging a wolf (on the pub named Hell Hunt, which means "gentle wolf"). The fork in the lane is marked by a tiny Russian Orthodox stone chapel. Then, on the left at #26, is the extremely ornate doorway of the...*

### ③ Brotherhood of the Black Heads

Built in 1440, this house was used as a German merchants' club for nearly 500 years (until Hitler invited Estonian Germans back to their historical fatherland in the 1930s). Before the 19th century, many Estonians lived as serfs on the rural estates of the German nobles who dominated the economy. In Tallinn, the German big shots were part of the Great Guild (which we'll see farther up the street), while the German little shots had to make do with the Brotherhood of the Black Heads. This guild, or business fraternity, was limited to single German men. In Hanseatic towns, when a fire or battle had to be fought, bachelors were deployed first, because they had no family. Because single men were considered unattached to the community, they had no opportunity for power in the Hanseatic social structure. When a Black Head member married a local woman, he automatically gained a vested interest in the town's economy and well-being. He could then join the Great Guild, and with that status, a promising economic and political future often opened up.

Today the hall is a concert venue (and, while you can pop in to get a peek—and use the WC—it's basically an empty shell). Its namesake "black head" is that of St. Maurice, an early Christian soldier-martyr, beheaded in the third century AD for his refusal to honor the Roman gods. Reliefs decorating the building recall Tallinn's Hanseatic glory days.

Keep going along Pikk street. The Estonian Handicraft House at #22 has delightful **Estonian knitwear** and crafts. Architecture fans enjoy several **fanciful facades** along here, including the boldly Art Nouveau #18. Across the street you may notice police protection and a colorful collection of Ukrainian flags and posters protesting a brutal and unjust war, pinned to barricades in front of the Russian Embassy.

On the left, at #16, the famous and recommended **Maiasmokk** ("Sweet Tooth") coffee shop, in business since 1864, remains a fine spot for a coffee-and-pastry break. In its pastry shop you can often see a baker painting the traditional marzipan.

*Just ahead, pause at the big yellow building on the right (at #17).*

### ④ Great Guild Hall (Suurgildi Hoone)

With its wide (and therefore highly taxed) front, the Great Guild Hall was the epitome of wealth. Remember, this was the home of the most prestigious of Tallinn's Hanseatic-era guilds. Today it houses the worthwhile **Museum of Estonian History**, offering a concise and engaging survey of this country's story (for details, see "Sights in Tallinn," later).

*Across Pikk street from the Great Guild Hall is the...*

### ⑤ Church of the Holy Ghost (Pühavaimu Kirik)

Sporting an outdoor clock from 1633, this pretty medieval church is worth a visit. The plaque on the wall just behind the ticket desk is in Estonian and Russian, but not English; this dates from before 1991, when things were designed for "inner tourism"—within the USSR. The church retains its 14th-century layout inside, where creaky wooden floors lead to a lovingly crafted wooden balcony and a pulpit painted with the "poor man's Bible" (scenes to inspire the illiterate). Sometimes flying from the back pillar, the old flag of Tallinn—the same as today's red-and-white Danish flag—recalls 13th-century Danish rule. (The name "Tallinn" means "Danish Town.") The Danes sold Tallinn to the German Teutonic Knights, who lost it to the Swedes, who lost it to the Russians. The windows are mostly from the 1990s.

**Cost and Hours:** €2; Mon-Fri 10:00-18:00, Sat from 11:00, closes earlier in winter, closed most of Sun to non-worshippers; English-language Lutheran services Sun at 13:00, free concerts Mon at 20:00; Pühavaimu 2, +372 646 4430, www.puhavaimu.ee.

*From here, it's a three-minute walk to the Tallinn City Life Museum—down the street to the left as you face the church (described later, under "Sights in Tallinn"). You can detour there now, or to continue this walk, follow the tiny lane along the right side the church. This is Saiakang lane (meaning "White Bread"—bread, cakes, and pies were long sold here), which leads to...*

### ⑥ Town Hall Square (Raekoja Plats)

A marketplace through the centuries, with a cancan of fine old buildings, the Town Hall Square is the focal point of the Old Town. This was the center of the autonomous lower town, a merchant city of Hanseatic traders. In medieval times here, criminals were chained to pillories for public humiliation, and knights showed off in chivalrous tournaments; today it's full of Scandinavians sipping beer.

At the passageway where you've entered the square, hook left, go 20 yards, and climb the steps into the **Raeapteek pharmacy**, dating from 1422 and claiming to be Europe's oldest (Mon-Sat 10:00-18:00, closed Sun). With an interior that goes back to medieval times, the still-operating pharmacy welcomes visitors with painted ceiling beams, English descriptions, and long-expired aspirin. Past the functioning counter is a room of display cases with historical exhibits.

The 15th-century **Town Hall** (Raekoda) dominates the square; it's open to visitors in summer, and climbing its tower earns you a commanding view (for details, see "Sights in Tallinn," later). Town Hall Square is ringed by inviting but touristy eateries. The TI is a block away.

*Facing the Town Hall, head right up Dunkri street—lined with several more eateries—one long block to the ⑦ wheel well, named for the "high-tech" pulley wheel, a marvel that made fetching water easier.*

*Turn left on Rataskaevu street (which soon becomes Rüütli) and walk two short blocks to...*

### ⑧ St. Nicholas Church (Niguliste Kirik)

This 13th-century Gothic church-turned-art-museum served the German merchants and knights who lived in this neighborhood 500 years ago. On March 9, 1944, while Tallinn was in German hands, Soviet forces bombed the city, and the church and surrounding area—once a charming district, dense with medieval buildings—were burned out; only the church was rebuilt. Today it's a starkly beautiful soaring Gothic space filled with fine medieval art. A striking glass elevator beams visitors effortlessly up the bell tower for a fine view.

**Cost and Hours:** €12; Tue-Sun 10:00-18:00, closed Mon year-round; organ or choir concerts Sat-Sun at 16:00 (free with ticket).

**Visiting the Church:** The church's interior houses a fine collection of mostly Gothic-era religious art.

Enter the church through the modern cellar, with photos of the WWII destruction of the building (including its toppled steeple). Then make your way into the vast, open church interior. Front and center is the collection's highlight: a retable (framed altarpiece) from 1481 by Herman Rode—an exquisite example of the northern Germanic late-Gothic style. Along with scenes from the life of St. Nicholas and an array of other saints, the altarpiece shows the skyline of Lübeck, Germany (Rode's hometown, and—like Tallinn—a Hanseatic trading city). The intricate symbolism is explained by a nearby touchscreen. Also look for another work by a Lübeck master, Bernt Notke's *Danse Macabre* (Dance of Death). Once nearly 100 feet long, the surviving fragment shows sinister skeletons approaching people from all walks of life. This common medieval theme reminds the viewer that life is fleeting, and no matter who we are, we'll all wind up in the same place.

*From the church, if you were to turn left and walk downhill on Rüütli street, you'd soon pass near Freedom Square (providing a taste of modern Tallinn; described later, under "Sights in Tallinn"). But for now, let's continue our walk into the upper town.*

---

## UPPER TOWN (TOOMPEA)

*At the corner opposite the church, climb uphill along the steep, cobbled, Lühike Jalg ("Short Leg Lane"), home to several quality craft shops. At the top of the lane, pause at the arched gateway at #9. Notice the stone tower steps leading to the arched passage and a big oak door. This is one of two gates through the wall separating the upper and lower towns. This passage is still the ritual meeting point of the mayor and prime minister whenever there is an important agreement between town and country.*

*Now continue straight (not climbing the stepped passage on the right) through the main gateway and climb up until you emerge into a beautiful view terrace in front of the city walls.*

---

### ⑨ City Walls and Gardens

This view terrace is known as the Danish King's Garden for the ruler who gave the land to the lower town in 1311. Tallinn is famous among Danes as the birthplace of their flag. According to legend, the Danes were losing a battle here, when suddenly, a white cross fell from heaven and landed in a pool of blood. The Danes were inspired and went on to win, and to this day, their flag is a white cross on a red background.

Once you pass through the opening in the wall (to the right after you pass through the main gate), you've officially crossed from the lower to upper town. The imposing city wall once had 46 towers, of which 26 still stand. If interested, you can climb some of the towers and ramparts (see below; note that we'll be reaching other dramatic viewpoints—overlooking different parts of town—later on this walk).

For a genuine tower climb, visit the stout, round **Kiek in de Kök tower**, with extremely tight, twisty, steep stone staircases inside (€8 combo-ticket also covers nearby Neitsitorn tower, both open daily except closed Mon off-season). The fun-to-say name "Kiek in de Kök" is Low German for "Peek in the Kitchen"—so-called because the tower was situated to allow guards to literally peek into townspeople's homes. While there are not many real artifacts, you'll see cannons, mannequins, model ships, videos, and models of the castle to give you a taste of Tallinn's medieval heyday.

*From the Kiek in de Kök tower, steer toward the big, onion-domed church poking up above the trees; circle around to the far side (facing the pink palace) to find the entrance. (You'll pass great rampart and tower views and perhaps a chance to enjoy a little archery.)*

### ⑩ Alexander Nevsky Cathedral (Aleksander Nevski Katedraal)

This Russian Orthodox cathedral—worth ▲▲—is a gorgeous building. But ever since the day it was built (in 1900), it has been a jab in the eye for Estonians. The church went up near the end of the two centuries when Estonia was part of the Russian Empire. And, as throughout Europe in the late 19th century, oppressed ethnic groups like the Estonians were caught up in national revival movements—celebrating their own culture, language, and history rather than that of their Russian overlords. So, the Russians flexed their cultural muscle by building this church in this location, facing the traditional Estonian seat of power, and over the supposed grave of a legendary Estonian hero, Kalevipoeg. They also tore down a statue of Martin Luther to make room.

**Cost and Hours:** Free, daily 8:00-18:00, Sat until 19:00, OK to visit discreetly during services (daily at 8:30 and 17:00); gift shop.

**Visiting the Church:** The church has been exquisitely renovated inside and out. Step inside for a sample of Russian Orthodoxy; you may hear priests singing the liturgy in a side chapel. Typical of Russian Orthodox churches, it has glittering icons (the highest concentration fills the big iconostasis screen that shields the altar from the congregation), no pews (worshippers stand throughout the service), and air that's heavy with incense. All of these features combine to create a mystical, otherworldly worship experience. Notice the many candles, each representing a prayer; if there's a request or a thank-you in your heart, you're welcome to buy one at the desk by the door. Exploring this space, keep in mind that about 40 percent of Tallinn's population is ethnic Russian.

*Across the street is the...*

### ⑪ Toompea Castle (Toompea Loss)

The pink palace is an 18th-century Russian addition onto the medieval Toompea Castle. Today, it's the Estonian Parliament (Riigikogu) building, flying the Estonian flag—the flag of both the first (1918-1940) and second (1991-present) Estonian republics. Notice the Estonian seal: three lions for three great battles in Estonian history, and oak leaves for strength and stubbornness. Consider the beauty of how this little country—with just under a million ethnic Estonians—can survive with such a proud and rich heritage in this rough and tumble world. Ancient pagan Estonians, who believed spirits lived in oak trees, would walk through forests of oak to toughen up. To this day, Estonian cemeteries are in forests. Keeping some of their pagan sensibilities, they believe the spirits of the departed live on in the trees.

*Facing the palace, go left through the gate into the park to see the...*

---

### ⑫ Tall Hermann Tower (Pikk Hermann)

This tallest tower of the castle wall is a powerful symbol for Estonians. For 50 years, while Estonian flags were hidden in cellars, the Soviet flag flew from Tall Hermann. As the USSR was unraveling, Estonians defiantly replaced the red Soviet flag here with their own blue, black, and white flag.

*Backtrack to the square in front of the palace, passing the Russian church on your right. Climb Toom-Kooli street to the...*

---

### ⑬ Dome Church (Toomkirik)

Estonia is ostensibly Lutheran, but few Tallinners go to church. A recent Gallup Poll showed Estonia to be the least religious country in the European Union—only 14 percent of respondents identified religion as an important part of their daily lives. Most churches double as concert venues or museums, but this one is still used for worship. Officially St. Mary's Church—but popularly called the Dome Church—it's a perfect example of simple Northern European Gothic, built in the 13th century during Danish rule, then rebuilt after a 1684 fire. Once the church of Tallinn's wealthy German-speaking aristocracy, it's littered with more than a hundred coats of arms, carved by local masters as memorials to the deceased and inscribed with German tributes to men who used to be important. The earliest dates from the 1600s, the latest from around 1900.

**Cost and Hours:** €2, €5 for 140-step Baroque tower climb, daily 10:00-17:00, organ recitals Sat at 12:00, www.toomkirik.ee.

*Leaving the church, turn left and hook around the back of the building. Head down cobbled Rahukohtu lane (to the right of the yellow house with a peaked roof).*

---

### Rahukohtu Lane

Notice the tranquility of this quarter: There's almost no regular commerce here; just government, diplomats, and tourists. Strolling the street, you'll spot embassy signs—government offices and embassies have moved into these buildings and spruced up the neighborhood. The prime minister's residence is on the left in the Neoclassical Stenbock House (explained by plaque on the right). Left of the gate, a memorial plaque honors nearly a hundred Estonian leaders—presidents, prime ministers, and other politicians who died in the 1940s—guilty of Estonian patriotism and victims of the USSR.

*Continue straight under the arch and belly up to the grand...*

---

### ⑭ Patkuli Viewpoint

Survey the scene. On the far left, the Neoclassical facade of the executive branch of Estonia's government overlooks a grand view. Below you, a bit of the old moat remains. Out on the water, ferries shuttle to and from Helsinki (just 50 miles away). Beyond the lower town's medieval wall you'll see the green spire of St. Olav's Church, once 98 feet taller and, locals claim, the world's tallest tower in 1492. Far in the distance is the 1,000-foot-tall TV tower, the site of a standoff between Soviet paratroopers and Estonian patriots in 1991 (see page 794).

During Soviet domination, Finnish TV was even more important, as it gave Estonians their only look at Western lifestyles. Imagine: In the 1980s, many locals had never seen a banana or a pineapple—except on TV. People still talk of the day that Finland broadcast the soft-porn movie *Emmanuelle*. A historic migration of Estonians purportedly flocked from the countryside to Tallinn to get within rabbit-ear's distance of Helsinki and see all that flesh onscreen. The refurbished TV tower is now open to visitors.

Before leaving the viewpoint, find the big city map. Take a moment to retrace your steps. (From the next viewpoint, your tour is essentially done. Trace where you'll go from there.)

*Go back through the arch, turn left down the narrow lane, turn right (onto Toom-Rüütli), take the first left, and pass through the trees to the...*

### ⑮ Kohtuotsa Viewpoint

Scan the view from left to right. On the far left is St. Olav's Church, then the busy cruise port and the skinny white spire of the Church of the Holy Ghost. The narrow gray spire farther to the right is the 16th-century Town Hall tower. On the far right is the tower of St. Nicholas Church. Below you, trace Pikk street, Tallinn's historic main drag, which winds through the Old Town, leading from Toompea Castle down the hill (from right to left), through the gate tower, past the Church of the Holy Ghost, behind St. Olav's, and out to the harbor. Less picturesque is the clutter of Soviet-era apartment blocks breaking the distant horizon, but these days they're being crowded out by modern high-rises. The nearest skyscraper (white) is Hotel Viru, in Soviet times the biggest hotel in the Baltics. Underneath the hotel is the modern Viru Keskus, a huge shopping mall and local transit center. To the left of Hotel Viru, between it and the ferry terminals, is the Rotermann Quarter, a former industrial area that's been revamped into a trendy new commercial zone. As you enjoy this view, look at the distant cityscape and remember that tourists generally focus on the old historic core of any city. Ninety percent of Tallinn rarely sees a tourist.

---

### ⑯ Return to Town Hall Square

Here is the most direct and interesting way to descend to the lower town: From the viewpoint, go left down Kohtu, past the Finnish Embassy (on your left). It's all downhill from here. At the onion domes, turn left again and follow the old wall down Pikk Jalg ("Long Leg Lane") into the lower town. Go under the tower, then straight on Pikk street. After two doors turn right on Voorimehe, which leads into Town Hall Square.

*Your tour is essentially over. From the square, you could find your way to Viru street and walk between the medieval towers—⑰ Viru Gate—that mark the end of old Tallinn. Outside the gate, above the flower stalls on the right, is a small park on a piece of old bastion known as the Kissing Hill (visit after dark and you'll find out why). Across the busy boulevard is the Rotermann Quarter (stretching to the left) and dead-ahead is the iconic communist-era ⑱ Hotel Viru, with a great (and free) view bar on its 23rd floor, and the huge, modern Viru Keskus mall.*
