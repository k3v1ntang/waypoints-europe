# Helsinki City Walk

**Duration:** ~1.5 hours
**Start:** Market Square (Kauppatori)
**End:** Oodi Library
**Optional Extension:** Iconic Architecture Stroll (Temppeliaukio Church)

This self-guided walk offers a convenient spine for your Helsinki sightseeing, starting at Market Square and ending just beyond the train station at the Oodi Library. With more time, you can continue from there to visit more of the city's cultural landmarks, finishing at the Temppeliaukio Church with an optional bus trip to two additional sights.

*Start at the obelisk in the center of the harborfront market.*

## 1. Market Square (Kauppatori)

This obelisk, with its double-headed eagle of imperial Russia, is the **Czarina's Stone**. It was the first public monument in Helsinki, designed by Carl Ludvig Engel and erected in 1835 to celebrate the first visit by a Russian empress (when Czarina Alexandra and Czar Nicholas I came to town). Stand here for a clockwise spin-tour:

Begin by facing the **harbor**. The big, red Viking ship and white Silja ship are floating hotels for those making the 40-hour Stockholm-Helsinki round-trip. Farther back, a giant Ferris wheel spins over the harbor (SkyWheel Helsinki, www.skywheel.fi). Now pan to the right. The brick-and-tan building along the harborfront is the **Old Market Hall**, with some enticing, more upscale options than the basic grub at the outdoor market (for a rundown on both options, see "Eating in Helsinki," later). Between here and there, a number of harbor cruise boats vie for your business.

Farther to the right, linden trees mark the beginning of Helsinki's grand promenade, the **Esplanade**. Hiding in the leaves is the venerable iron-and-glass **Café Kappeli**. To the right of the Esplanade, a string of Neoclassical buildings lines the harbor. The blue-and-white City Hall—designed by Engel in 1833—was the town's first luxury hotel. The Lutheran Cathedral is hidden from view behind this building. Next, after the short peach-colored building, is the Swedish Embassy (flying the blue-and-yellow Swedish flag and designed to look like Stockholm's Royal Palace). Then comes the Supreme Court and, tucked back in the far corner, Finland's Presidential Palace. Finally, standing proud (and reminding Helsinki of the Russian behemoth to its east) is the **Uspenski Cathedral**.

Explore the colorful **outdoor market**—part souvenirs and crafts, part fruit and veggies, part fish and snacks. The produce is fresh and tasty with lots of generous samples. Orange tents sell food, while white tents sell souvenirs.

*Done exploring? Walk to the corner of Market Square at City Hall and turn right up Sofiankatu street, with its old cobbles leading to modern cobbles.*

Part way up Sofiankatu, at the City Hall entrance on the right (at #1A), notice the historic street sign in Russian along with Swedish and Finnish—you know it dates to before independence from Russia in 1917. Inside, the workers' cafeteria welcomes the public for lunch (Mon-Fri, €14 including coffee and dessert). There's a free WC across the street.

*Near the end of the block, you'll pop out right in the middle of...*

## 2. Senate Square (Senaatintori)

This was once a simple town square with a church and City Hall—but its original buildings were burned in 1808. Later, after Finland became a grand duchy of the Russian Empire, the czar sent in architect Carl Ludvig Engel (a German who had lived and worked in St. Petersburg) to give the place some Neo-class. The result: the finest Neoclassical square in Europe. Engel represents the paradox of Helsinki: The city as we know it was built by Russia, but with an imported European architect, in a very intentionally European style. So, Helsinki is—in a sense—both entirely Russian...and not Russian in the slightest.

The statue in the center of the square honors **Russian Czar Alexander II**. The czar who freed the serfs (and was assassinated) was well liked by the Finns. That's because he gave Finland more autonomy in 1863 and didn't push the Russification of Finland.

The huge **staircase** leading up to the **Lutheran Cathedral** is a popular meeting (and tanning) spot in Helsinki. Head up those stairs and survey Senate Square from the top. Scan the square from left to right. First, 90 degrees to your left is the yellow **Senate building** (now the prime minister's office). The small, blue-gray stone building with the slanted mansard roof in the far-left corner, from 1757, is one of just a few pre-Russian-conquest buildings surviving in Helsinki (it's now the home of the Helsinki City Museum). **Café Engel** (opposite the cathedral at Aleksanterinkatu 26) is a fine place for a light lunch or cake and coffee. The café's winter lighting seems especially designed to boost the spirits of daylight-deprived northerners. (This latitude has just six hours of daylight in the dead of winter.)

Facing the Senate directly across the square is its twin, the **University of Helsinki's** main building (36,000 students). Symbolically (and physically), the university and government buildings are connected via the cathedral, and both use it as a starting point for grand ceremonies.

Tucked alongside the cathedral, a line of once-grand Russian administration buildings now house the **National Library of Finland**. In czarist times, the National Library received a copy of every book printed in Imperial Russia. With all the chaos Russia suffered throughout the 20th century, a good percentage of its Slavic texts were destroyed. But Helsinki, which enjoyed relative stability, claims to have the finest collection of Slavic books in the world. This purpose-built Neoclassical building, its facade lined with Corinthian columns, is one of Engel's finest and worth a look.

If you'd like to visit the **cathedral interior**, now's your chance; the entrance is around the left side as you face the towering dome (for details, see "More Sights in Helsinki," later).

*When you're ready, head back down the stairs and angle right through the square, continuing straight down Unioninkatu.*

Along **Unioninkatu**, do a little window-shopping; this is the first of many streets we'll see lined with made-in-Finland shops. In addition to jewelers and clothes boutiques, look for the Schröder sporting goods store (on the left, at #23), which shows off its famous selection of popular Finnish-made Rapala fishing lures—ideal for the fisher folk on your gift list. At #30 you'll see one of the more than hundred Art Nouveau facades that grace the city.

At the end of this street, cross over to reach the fountain and female statue called *Havis Amanda*. Designed by Ville Vallgren and unveiled here in 1908, the statue has become the symbol of Helsinki, the city known as the "Daughter of the Baltic." Graduating students decorate her with a school cap every May. The voluptuous figure, modeled after the artist's Parisian mistress, was a bit too racy for the conservative town, and Vallgren had trouble getting paid. But as artists often do, Vallgren had the last laugh: The city budget office across the street sees only her backside.

*Now turn toward the Esplanade's grassy median, with the delightful...*

## 3. Café Kappeli

Dip into this old-fashioned, gazebo-like oasis of coffee, pastry, and relaxation and enjoy the Old World atmosphere. In the 19th century, this was a popular hangout for local intellectuals and artists. Today the café offers romantic tourists waiting for their ship a great cup-of-coffee memory. The bandstand in front hosts nearly daily music and dance performances in summer. (You can pick up what you like at the self-serve counter and sit anywhere. Locals love the salmon, soup-and-bread lunch specials, and free seconds.)

*Shoppers will note that directly across from Kappeli are several beloved Finnish design shops...*

---

## 4. Iittala, Arabia, and Aarikka

Design like you'll see on display in **Iittala** and **Arabia** is big for Finns: practical for everyday use, affordable, with a simple Nordic aesthetic. **Arabia** has been recognized as a mark of quality and unpretentious class since 1873. Their ceramic pieces are considered lifelong investments in everyday luxury, and their warm colors are beloved in the land of long dark winters. Iittala is its sister brand, with classic Finnish glassware. A block away, **Aarikka** specializes in clothing, jewelry, and home goods. We'll pass other famous design shops soon; for details, see "Shopping in Helsinki," later.

*Between the café and shops stretches...*

## 5. The Esplanade (Esplanaden)

Helsinki's top shopping boulevard comes with a park in the middle. Called the Esplanade, it leads to a street called Bulevardi. The grandiose names, while fitting today, would have been purely aspirational in rustic little 1830s Helsinki (whose population was only about 10,000).

The Esplanade was laid out in 1826 by Engel under Russian rule. The czars were Francophiles, so they made the Esplanade feel a bit like the Champs-Elysées. It was (with a good imagination) a little bit of Paris in the north. Today, the park is the green heart of the city. As you stroll, admire the mature linden trees and imagine this elegant promenade in the old days. The Esplanade connects the old city of the late 1700s—the established power center—with the new parts of town, where impressive stone houses in a neo-Renaissance style would be built by the late 1800s.

Notice the ornately decorated **Hotel Kämp** (on the right at #29). This city landmark is typical of the elegant hotels, shops, and restaurants that began springing up in the late 19th century as the Esplanade became a place to be seen. Today, the street's exclusive air is maintained by enterprises such as **Galleria Kämp** (entrance at #31), a high-end fashion mall with big-name Finnish and international stores, and the **Strindberg Café**, one of many tony spots along the Esplanade for a drink.

At the very top of the Esplanade, the park dead-ends at the **Swedish Theater**. Built under Russian rule to cater to Swedish residents of a Finnish city, this building encapsulates Helsinki's complex cultural mix. (The theater's recommended Teatterin deli is a handy spot for a meal out in the park.)

Across from the theater, at #39, is the huge **Academic Bookstore** (Akateeminen Kirjakauppa), designed by Modernist architect Alvar Aalto, with an extensive map and travel section, periodicals, English books, and the Café Aalto (with ageless Aalto furniture) on the back mezzanine level.

*At the end of the Esplanade, turn right, and you'll reach the pedestrianized Keskuskatu street with several landmarks of Finnish shopping and design...*

## 6. Artek, Marimekko, and Stockmann

Around the corner and down the street from the Academic Bookstore is **Artek**, founded in 1935 by Alvar Aalto to showcase his practical, modern designs for furniture and housewares. And at the far corner is perhaps Finland's most famous export: **Marimekko**, the fabric designer whose bold and colorful patterns adorn everything from purses to shower curtains (more Marimekko branches are within a block of here). The other side of the street is dominated by **Stockmann**, the biggest, best, and oldest department store in town (with a sprawling supermarket in the basement).

*At the corner of Keskuskatu and Aleksanterinkatu, in front of Marimekko, walk left and see a landmark statue, the...*

## 7. Three Blacksmiths

While there's no universally accepted meaning for this statue (from 1932), most say it celebrates human labor and cooperation and shows the solid character of the Finnish people. On the base, note the surviving shrapnel damage from World War II. Russia used that war as an opportunity to invade Finland—which it had lost just 20 years prior—to try to reclaim their buffer zone. In a two-part war (the Winter War from 1939 to 1940, then the Continuation War from 1941 to 1944), Finland held fast and emerged with its freedom—and relatively little damage.

Stockmann's entrance on Aleksanterinkatu, facing the *Three Blacksmiths*, is one of the city's most popular meeting points. Everyone in Finland knows exactly what it means when you say: "Let's meet under the clock." Across the street from the clock, the Old Student Hall is decorated with legendary Finnish heroes.

*For a shortcut to our next stop, from the statue go about 100 feet downhill. On the left, duck through the passage (marked City-Käytävä) directly across the street from Stockmann's clock. This will take you through a bustling commercial zone. You'll enter—and continue straight through—the City Center shopping mall. Emerging on the far side, you're face-to-face with four granite giants guarding the...*

## 8. Central Train Station (Rautatieasema)

This Helsinki landmark was designed by Eliel Saarinen (see the "Two Men Who Remade Helsinki" sidebar). The big, stern figures on the facade, carrying illuminated globes, seem to have stepped right out of a Nordic myth.

With your back to the train station, look to the left; diagonally across the square is the **Ateneum**, Finland's national gallery of art. It faces the **Finnish National Theater** (not visible from here)—founded to promote Finnish-speaking theater in the years Finland was dominated by Swedish speakers.

Duck into the main hall of the train station. Peek into the Olivia Restaurant inside (on the left) to catch the building's early 20th-century architectural razzle-dazzle.

Then, step out to the train platform. Before Russia invaded Ukraine (ending service for now), you could ride the rails from here to St. Petersburg in less than four hours, then go overnight to Moscow and all the way to Hong Kong with just two changes.

*Leave the station out the back (to the left as you face the tracks). Cross the huge square kitty-corner and go between two large glass buildings to the new library. It's the swooping glass and wood building a block ahead.*

## 9. Oodi Library

Helsinki's central library (worth ▲▲)—Oodi is pronounced "awdi," which means "ode"—opened in 2018 to celebrate the 101st birthday of Finland's independence. Facing the parliament and other institutions of art, culture, and democracy, its facade is covered with planks of Finnish spruce. A third of the space is dedicated to books and the rest is a creative collection of anything the community might need or appreciate (free, daily 8:00-21:00).

Loitering is encouraged, so browse around to explore a library of the future with a passion for practical offerings. You'll see intense chess games, a sleeping zone, sewing stations, soundproof recording studios, game rooms, and free meeting spaces for clubs and nonprofit organizations. You can use the 3-D printer, borrow games or sports gear (even skis), and use the WC. Oh, and you can check out books! Don't miss Vera—the robot who helps with restocking books.

Appreciate the grand, central spiral staircase decorated with words that describe the kinds of people welcome in the library: the henpecked, chubby folk, babies, victims of war, fundamentalists, prudes, tourists...essentially everybody.

Finish your walk at the view terrace on the top floor. Spreading before you are many of the most iconic buildings in the city. From left to right, you can see the curvy Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art, the parliament house (from 1931), the green glass Helsinki Music Center, the National Museum (with its green tower), Alvar Aalto's white Finlandia Hall, and, in the distance, the 1952 Olympic Stadium (with its tall skinny white tower).

*We've covered the highlights of the town center. Several important buildings near the library await your exploration on the next walk, the...*
