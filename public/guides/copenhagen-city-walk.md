# Copenhagen City Walk

This self-guided walk takes about two hours. It starts at Rådhuspladsen (City Hall Square) and heads along the pedestrian street, the Strøget, through the old city, onto the island of Slotsholmen (home of Christiansborg Palace), along the harbor promenade, and through Nyhavn, the sailors' quarter with the city's iconic canal-front houses. The walk officially ends at Kongens Nytorv ("King's New Square"), though you can detour another 10 minutes to Amalienborg Palace and then another 15 minutes beyond that to The Little Mermaid.

## 1. Rådhuspladsen

Start from Rådhuspladsen, the bustling heart of Copenhagen, dominated by the tower of the City Hall. For 700 years, Copenhagen was contained within its city walls, and this square was its fortified west end. By the mid-1800s, 140,000 people were packed inside. The overcrowding led to hygiene problems. (A cholera outbreak killed 5,000.) It was clear: The walls needed to come down...and they did. Those formidable town walls survive today only in echoes—a circular series of roads and the remnants of moats, which are now people-friendly city lakes (see the sidebar on page 43). Today, with its convenient Metro station, Rådhuspladsen is where the city gathers to celebrate.

**Stand 50 yards in front of City Hall and turn clockwise for a...**

**Rådhuspladsen Spin-Tour:** The City Hall, or Rådhus, is worth a visit (described on page 77). Old Hans Christian Andersen sits to the right of City Hall, almost begging to be in another photo (as he used to in real life). Climb onto his well-worn knee. (While up there, you might take off your shirt for a racy photo, as many Danes enjoy doing.)

## 2. Tivoli Gardens

H. C. is looking at Tivoli Gardens (across the street), which he loved and which inspired him. Tivoli Gardens was founded in 1843, when magazine publisher Georg Carstensen convinced the king to let him build a pleasure garden outside the walls of crowded Copenhagen. The king quickly agreed, knowing that happy people care less about fighting for democracy. Tivoli became Europe's first great public amusement park. When the train lines came, the station was placed just beyond Tivoli.

The big, glassy building with the DI sign is filled with the offices of Danish Industry—a collection of Danish companies whose logos you can see in the windows.

## 3. Vesterbrogade & Weather Girls

The big, broad boulevard is Vesterbrogade ("Western Way"), which led to the western gate of the medieval city (behind you, where the pedestrian boulevard begins). Here, in the traffic hub of this huge city, you'll notice...not many cars. Throughout Copenhagen, you'll see how the mayor's mantra, "We will build a city not for cars but for people"—along with tax-and-regulation policies that encourage small electric cars and use of public transit and bikes—is shaping the city.

Down Vesterbrogade towers the Radisson Blu Royal Hotel (with its SAS sign), once Copenhagen's only skyscraper. When it was built in 1960, Copenhageners took one look and decided—that's enough of a skyline. Notice there are no other buildings taller than the five-story limit in the old center.

The golden weather girls (on the corner, high above Vesterbrogade) indicate the weather: on a bike (fair weather) or with an umbrella (foul). These two have been called the only women in Copenhagen you can trust, but for years they've been stuck in the almost-sunny mode...with the bike just peeking out. You'll notice that the red temperature dots max out at 28° Celsius (that's 82° Fahrenheit...a good memory aid: transpose 28 to get 82).

Farther to the right, the next street (once the local Fleet Street, with the big newspapers) still has the offices for Politiken (one of Denmark's leading newspapers) and the best bookstore in town, Politikens Boghal.

As you spin farther right, three fast-food joints stand at the entry to the Strøget, Copenhagen's grand pedestrian boulevard—where we're heading next. Just beyond that and the Art Deco-style Palace Hotel (with a tower to serve as a sister to the City Hall) is the Lur Blowers sculpture, which honors the earliest warrior Danes. The lur is a curvy, trombone-sounding horn perhaps used to call soldiers to battle or to accompany pagan religious processions. The earliest bronze lurs date as far back as 3,500 years ago. Later, the Vikings used a wood version of the lur. The ancient originals, which still play, are displayed in the National Museum.

Down the street, on the left side of City Hall, the Rainbow Square (Regnbuepladsen) marked by a pride flag is a reminder that in 1989 Denmark was the first country in the world to give legal rights to same-sex partnerships and has long been a leader in gay rights.

**Now head down the pedestrian boulevard (pickpocket alert).**

## 4. The Strøget

The American trio of Burger King, 7-Eleven, and KFC marks the start of this touristy pedestrian street. Finished in 1962, Copenhagen's experimental, tremendously successful, and much-copied pedestrian shopping mall is a string of lively (and individually named) streets and squares that bunny-hop through the old town from City Hall to the Nyhavn quarter, a 20-minute stroll away. Though the Strøget has become hamburgerized, historic bits and attractive pieces of old Copenhagen are just off this commercial can-can.

As you wander, remember that the commercial success of a historic street like the Strøget drives up the land value, which generally trashes the charm and tears down the old buildings. Look above the modern window displays and street-level advertising to discover bits of 19th-century character that still survive. This end of the Strøget is young and cheap, while the far end has the high-end designer shops.

Along the way, wonderfully quiet and laid-back areas are just a block or two away on either side. (Many visitors never venture off Strøget, and many locals never venture onto it.) After one block (at Kattesundet), make a side trip three blocks left, straight into Copenhagen's colorful university district (Latin Quarter). Notice, just 100 yards off Strøget, the totally different vibe. Formerly the old brothel neighborhood, later the heart of Copenhagen's hippie community in the 1960s, today this student area is SoHo chic. Enjoy the colorful string of artsy shops, vintage-clothing joints, and cafés.

Because the old town was densely populated and built of wood, very little survived its many fires. After half-timbered and thatched buildings kept burning down, the city finally mandated that new construction be made of stone. But because stone was so expensive, many people built half-timbered structures, then disguised their facades with stucco, which made them look like stone. Keep an eye out for exposed half-timbered structures in courtyards and from the back sides.

At Sankt Peders Stræde, turn right and walk to the end of the street. Notice the old guild signs (a baker, a key maker, and so on) identifying the original businesses here. Look for large mansions that once circled expansive courtyards. As the city's population grew, the city walls constricted Copenhagen's physical size. The courtyards were gradually filled with higgledy-piggledy secondary buildings. Today throughout the old center, you can step off a busy pedestrian mall and back in time in these characteristic, time-warp courtyards. Replace the parked car with a tired horse and the bikes with a line of outhouses, and you're in 19th-century Copenhagen. If you see an open courtyard door, you're welcome to discreetly wander in and look around.

You'll also pass funky shops and the big brick St. Peter's Church (Sankt Petri Kirke)—the old German merchant community's church, which still holds services in German. Its fine 17th-century brick funerary chapel (filling a ground-floor building out back due to the boggy nature of the soil) is filled with fancy German tombs (church and burial chapels typically open to visitors Thu-Sat 11:00-15:00).

**When Sankt Peders Stræde intersects with Nørregade, look right to find the big, Neoclassical...**

## 6. Cathedral of Our Lady (Vor Frue Kirke)

The obelisk-like Reformation Memorial across the street from the cathedral celebrates Denmark's break from the Roman Catholic Church to become Lutheran in 1536. Walk around and study the reliefs of great Danish reformers protesting from their pulpits. The relief facing the church shows King Christian III presiding over the pivotal town council meeting when they decided to break away from Rome. As a young man, Prince Christian had traveled to Germany, where he was influenced by Martin Luther. He returned to take the Danish throne by force, despite Catholic opposition. Realizing the advantages of being the head of his own state church, Christian dissolved the monasteries, confiscated church property, and established the state Lutheran Church. King Christian was crowned inside this cathedral. Because of the reforms of 1536, there's no Mary in the Cathedral of Our Lady. The other reliefs show the popular religious uprising, with Danes taking control of the word of God by translating the Bible from Latin into their own language.

Like much of this part of town, the church burned down in the 1807 British bombardment of the city during the Napoleonic Wars. Rebuilt in the Neoclassical style, the cathedral's facade looks like a Greek temple. (Two blocks to the right, in the distance, notice more Neoclassicism—the law courts.) You can see why golden age Copenhagen (early 1800s) fancied itself a Nordic Athens. Old Testament figures (King David and Moses) flank the cathedral's entryway. Above, John the Baptist stands where you'd expect to see Greek gods. He invites you in...into the New Testament.

The interior is a world of Neoclassical serenity (free, open Mon-Sat 8:00-17:00, Sun 12:00-16:30). It feels like a pagan temple that now houses Christianity. The nave is lined by the 12 apostles, clad in classical robes—masterpieces by the great Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen (see page 87). Each strikes a meditative pose, carrying his identifying symbol: Peter with keys, Andrew with the X-shaped cross of his execution, Matthew and John writing their books, and so on. They lead to a statue of the Risen Christ (see photo), standing where the statue of Zeus would have been: inside a temple-like niche, flanked by columns and topped with a pediment. Rather than wearing a royal robe, Jesus wears his burial shroud, opens his arms wide, and says, "Come to me." (Members of the LDS church will recognize this statue—a replica stands in the visitors center at Salt Lake City's Temple Square.) The marvelous acoustics are demonstrated in free organ concerts Saturdays in July and August at noon (schedule at entry). Notice how, in good Protestant style, the front half of the pews are "reversible," allowing the congregation to flip around and face the pulpit (in the middle of the church) to better hear the sermon.

**Head back outside. If you face the church's facade and look to the left (across the square called Frue Plads), you'll see...**

## 7. Copenhagen University

Now home to nearly 40,000 students, this university was founded by the king in the 15th century to stop the Danish brain drain to Paris. Today tuition is free. Locals say it's easy to get in, but given the wonderful student lifestyle, very hard to get out.

Outside, busts honor great minds from the faculty, including (at the far end) Niels Bohr, a professor who won the 1922 Nobel Prize for theoretical physics. He evaded the clutches of the Nazi science labs by fleeing to America in 1943, where he helped develop the atomic bomb.

**Rejoin the Strøget (one block downhill from the Reformation Memorial to the black-and-gold fountain) at the twin squares called...**

## 8. Gammeltorv and Nytorv

This was the old town center. In Gammeltorv ("Old Square"), the Fountain of Charity (Caritas) is named for the figure of Charity on top. It has provided drinking water to locals since the early 1600s. Featuring a pregnant woman squirting water from her breasts next to a boy urinating, this was just too much for people of the Victorian Age. They corked both figures and raised the statue to what they hoped would be out of view. (Today, the water flows freely.)

The exotic-looking kiosk was one of the city's first community telephone centers from the days before phones were privately owned. Look at the reliefs ringing its top: an airplane with bird wings (c. 1900) and (two panels to the right, flanking a fortress) two women talking on a newfangled telephonic device.

While Gammeltorv was a place of happiness and merriment, Nytorv ("New Square") was a place of severity and judgment. Step up onto the small raised area 20 yards in front of the old, ancient-Greek-style former City Hall and courthouse. Do a 360. The square is Neoclassical (built mostly after the 1807 British bombardment). Read the old Danish on the City Hall facade: "With Law Shall Man Build the Land." Look down at the pavement and read the plaque: "Here stood the town's Kag (whipping post) until 1780."

**Now walk down the next stretch of the Strøget—called Nygade—to reach...**

## 9. Amagertorv

This is prime real estate for talented street entertainers. Walk past the flagship Lego store (on right) to the stately brick Holy Ghost Church (Helligåndskirken). The fine spire is typical of old Danish churches. Under the stepped gable was a medieval hospital run by monks (one of the oldest buildings in town, dating from the 12th century). Today the hospital is an antiques hall. In summer the pleasant courtyard is shared by a group of charities selling light bites and coffee. The green hotdog stand, Hanegal, sells what's considered the best pølse in town, breaking the gut-bomb mold with organic sausages and innovative sides (handy churchyard nearby to sit and munch).

**Walk behind the church, down Valkendorfsgade—the street just before the church—and through a passage under the reddish-colored building at #32 (if locked, loop back and go down Klosterstræde) to find...**

## 10. Gråbrødretorv

Surrounded by fine old buildings, this leafy and beer-stained "Grey Friars' Square"—a monastic square until the Reformation made it a people's square—is a popular place for an outdoor meal or drink in the summer. At the end of the square, the street called Niels Hemmingsens Gade runs past a neighborhood known for its design shops back to the Strøget.

**Once back on busy Strøget, turn left and continue down Amagertorv, with its fine inlaid Italian granite stonework, to the square with the Art Nouveau "stork" fountain (Storkespringvandet).**

## 11. "Stork" Fountain Spin Tour

Two entries to underground, Victorian-era WCs are in front of the fountain (free, staffed, and delightful). Stand between the twin stairwells for a 360-degree counterclockwise spin tour. The street ahead, a bit to the left, is Østergade (the fanciest shopping street in town). North of Amagertorv, a broad pedestrian mall called Købmagergade leads past a fine modern bakery (Holm's) to Christian IV's Round Tower. Farther around are three shopping institutions: Georg Jensen (luxury Danish design), Royal Copenhagen (with three floors of porcelain), and Illums Bolighus (department store offering modern Danish design—see "Shopping," later). Finally, a block downhill toward the canal—running parallel to the Strøget—starts Strædet, which is a "second Strøget" featuring cafés and antique shops. If you need a Victorian toilet break, just head downstairs.

**Looking downhill from the fountain, about halfway to the imposing palace in the distance, you'll see a great man on a horse. Walk here to view this statue of Copenhagen's founder, Bishop Absalon, shown in his Warrior Absalon getup.**

From the bishop, continue across a bridge toward the palace and the next statue—a king on a horse. As you cross the bridge, look right to see the City Hall tower, where this walk started. (Strömma's sightseeing cruises depart from near here—see page 56.)

## Christiansborg Palace and the Birthplace of Copenhagen

You're stepping onto the island of Slotsholmen ("Castle Island"), the easy-to-defend birthplace of Copenhagen in the 12th century. It's dominated by the royal palace complex. Christiansborg Palace (with its "three crowns" spire)—the former residence of kings—is now the parliament building.

Ahead of you, the Neoclassical Lutheran church with the low dome is the Christiansborg Palace Chapel, site of 350 years of royal weddings and funerals (free, open daily 10:00-18:00 in July, otherwise open only Sun until 17:00, closed Mon-Sat).

Walk to the green copper equestrian statue. Frederik VII was crowned in 1848, just months before signing Denmark's first constitution on June 5, 1849. (Constitution Day is celebrated with typical Danish understatement—stores are closed and workers get the day off.) Frederik, who then ruled as a constitutional monarch, stands in front of Christiansborg Palace, which Denmark's royal family now shares with its people's assembly (for info on visiting the palace, see page 83). This palace, the seat of Danish government today, is considered the birthplace of Copenhagen. It stands upon the ruins of Absalon's 12th-century castle (literally under your feet). The round stones between the statue and the street were put in for security after the 2011 terrorist attacks in Norway. While Danes strive to keep government accessible, security measures like this are today's reality.

This is Denmark's power island, with the Folketinget (Danish parliament), Supreme Court, Ministry of Finance (to the left), and the Børsen—the historic stock exchange (farther to the left, with the fanciful dragon-tail spire).

**Walk toward the old stock exchange.**

## 15. Børsen (Stock Exchange)

The eye-catching red-brick stock exchange (not open to tourists) was inspired by the Dutch Renaissance, like much of 17th-century Copenhagen. Built to promote the mercantile ambitions of Denmark in the 1600s, it was the "World Trade Center" of Scandinavia. The facade reads, "For the profitable use of buyer and seller." The dragon-tail spire with three crowns represents the Danish aspiration to rule a united Scandinavia—or at least be its commercial capital.

Notice Copenhagen's distinctive green copper spires all around you. Beyond the old stock exchange lies the island of Christianshavn, with its own distinct spire. It tops Our Savior's Church and features an external spiral staircase winding to the top for a commanding view. While political power resided here on Slotsholmen, commercial power was in the merchant's district, Christianshavn (neighborhood and church described later, under "Sights in Copenhagen"). The Børsen symbolically connected Christianshavn with the rest of the city, in an age when trade was a very big deal.

**Before you reach the end of the stock exchange building, turn left at the crosswalk with the signal. (Note that bus #2A goes from here to Our Savior's Church and Christiania; see the "Copenhagen Public Transportation" map, earlier.) Cross over the canal and turn right to walk along the harborfront promenade, enjoying views of Christianshavn across the water.**

## 16. Havnegade Promenade

The Havnegade promenade to Nyhavn is a delightful people zone with trampolines (stop for a bounce), an ice-cream-licking ambience, and harborview benches (a good place to stop, look across the water, and ponder the trendy apartments and old warehouses turned into modern-office blocks). From here, stroll several more blocks toward the Inderhavnsbroen sliding bridge for pedestrians and bikes. This "kissing bridge" (it's called that because the two sliding, or retractable, sections "kiss" when they come together) links the town center with Christianshavn and makes the modern Opera House (ahead on the right, across the water) more accessible to downtown.

Walk 30 meters out on the bridge and stand above the yellow window. It's a slow-motion ride when the center of the bridge slides open for big ships to pass (notice the cables and track). This bridge connects the previously remote, distant end of Christianshavn with the city center. The impetus was to connect the new Royal Danish Opera House, whose wealthy funder helped pay for the bridge (opened in 2016). Just across the bridge is a thriving street-food court and market and beyond that is the hippie town of Christiania and Our Savior's Church (with the striking spiral steeple). Take a moment to appreciate an urbanscape designed not for cars but for bikes and pedestrians.

Across the way, at the end of the canal, stands the glassy Royal Danish Theatre's Playhouse. While this walk finishes on Kongens Nytorv, the square at the head of the canal, you could extend it by continuing north along the harbor from the Playhouse (see the "Walk Extension," later).

**Now, leave the bridge the way you came and walk straight to the canal lined with old sailboats. Walk to the center of the bridge over the canal and look toward the center for a nice...**

## 18. View of Nyhavn

Established in the 1670s along with Kongens Nytorv, Nyhavn ("New Harbor") is a recently gentrified sailors' quarter. (Hong Kong is the last of the nasty bars from the rough old days.) The canal is filled with glamorous old sailboats of all sizes. Historic sloops are welcome to moor here in Copenhagen's ever-changing boat museum. Hans Christian Andersen lived and wrote his first stories here (in the red double-gabled building at #20). With its upscale cafés, jazz clubs, and tattoo shops (pop into Tattoo Ole at #17—fun photos, very traditional), Nyhavn is a wonderful place to hang out.

Historically, young locals who couldn't afford the trendy bars on this canal would buy a beer (for a quarter of the price) at a nearby minimarket and enjoy a canalside perch. (I'm told the tourists have driven the truly local crowd over the sliding bridge, to the distant Krøyers Plads embankment.) To get a 25-DKK beer, cross the bridge and continue a long block down Toldbodgade to Sankt Annæ Plads, where you'll find a classic corner minimarket—Den Gamle Købmand—with 100 local craft beers cooled and ready to go (open daily until 23:00). Then take your beer back to the canal and find a spot to sip. A note about all the public beer-drinking here: There's no more beer consumption here than in the US; it's just out in public.

If you crave ice cream instead, facing the canal you'll find Vaffelbageren, a popular place with freshly made waffle cones.

**Beer sipped or ice cream slurped, make your way to the head of the canal, where you'll find a minuscule amber museum (free), above the House of Amber (see "Shopping in Copenhagen," later). Just beyond the end of the canal sprawls the huge and the stately...**

## 19. Kongens Nytorv

The "King's New Square" is home to the Royal Theater, French embassy, and venerable Hotel d'Angleterre, where VIPs and pop stars stay. Long a messy construction site, it's now a tidy park that sits atop a major Metro station. In past winters, this square was a popular ice-skating rink.

In the mid-1600s the city expanded, pushing its wall farther east. The equestrian statue in the middle of the square celebrates Christian V, who made this square the city's geographical and cultural center. In 1676, King Christian rode off to reconquer the southern tip of Sweden and reclaim Denmark's dominance. He returned empty-handed and broke. Denmark became a second-rate power, but Copenhagen prospered.

Across the street, towering above the Metro station, is Magasin du Nord, the grandest old department store in town (with practical eating options in its basement and top floor).

**Just beyond the Metro station, at #19, under a bar, wander into...**

## 20. Hviids Vinstue

The town's oldest wine cellar (from 1723) has a characteristic dark and woody interior and fascinating old Copenhagen photos. It's a colorful spot for an open-face sandwich and a beer (three sandwiches and a beer for 90 DKK at lunchtime, sandwiches only as long as they last, daily 10:00-14:00). Their wintertime gløgg (hot spiced wine) is legendary.

**You've reached the end of this walk. But if you'd like to extend it by heading out to Amalienborg Palace and The Little Mermaid, retrace your steps to the far side of Nyhavn canal.**

## Walk Extension: Nyhavn to Amalienborg

Stroll along the canal to the Royal Danish Theatre's Playhouse and head left along the harborfront to a large plaza dotted with outdoor cafés and benches and views across the harbor. Then follow a delightful waterfront promenade to the modern fountain of Amaliehaven Park, immediately across the harbor from Copenhagen's slick Opera House. The striking Opera House is bigger than it looks—of its 14 floors, five are below sea level. Completed in 2005 by Danish architect Henning Larsen, it was a $400 million gift to the nation from an oil-shipping magnate.

**A block inland (behind the fountain) is the orderly...**

## 21. Amalienborg Palace and Square

Queen Margrethe II, who abdicated the throne in 2024, lives in the mansion to your immediate left as you enter the square from the harborside. The mansion across the street (on the right as you enter) is where her son, King Frederik X, lives with his wife Queen Mary—an Australian businesswoman—and their four children. (If the flag's flying, the king is home.) The royal guesthouse palace is on the far left. And the palace on the far right is the Amalienborg Museum, which offers an intimate look at royal living (described on page 89).

Though the guards change daily at noon, they do it with royal fanfare only when the king is in residence (see page 90 for details). The royal guard often has a police escort when it marches through town on special occasions—leading locals to joke that theirs is "the only army in the world that needs police protection."

The equestrian statue of Frederik V is a reminder that this square was the centerpiece of a planned town he envisioned in 1750. It was named for him—Frederikstaden. During the 18th century, Denmark's population grew and the country thrived (as trade flourished and its neutrality kept it out of the costly wars impoverishing much of Europe). Frederikstaden, with its strong architectural harmony, was designed as a luxury neighborhood for the city's business elite. Nobility and other big shots moved in, but the king came here only after his other palace burned down in a 1794 fire.

Just inland, the striking Frederikskirke—better known as the Marble Church—was designed to fit this ritzy new quarter. If it's open, step inside to bask in its vast, serene, Pantheon-esque atmosphere (free, Mon-Thu and Sat 10:00-17:00, Fri and Sun from 12:30; dome climb-50 DKK, daily at 13:00 except during services, concerts, or bad weather).

**If you're done, you can hop on the Metro (by the Marble Church, at the handy Marmorkirken stop) or return to the palace square and follow Amaliegade, which leads two blocks north to...**

## Kastellet Park

In this park, you'll find some worthwhile sightseeing (see the "Copenhagen" map on page 44). The 1908 Gefion Fountain illustrates the myth of the goddess who was given one night to carve a hunk out of Sweden to make into Denmark's main island, Sjælland (or "Zealand" in English), which you're on. Gefion transformed her four sons into oxen to do the job, and the chunk she removed from Sweden is supposedly Vänern, Sweden's largest lake. If you look at a map showing Sweden and Denmark, the island and the lake are, in fact, roughly the same shape. Next to the fountain is an Anglican church built of flint.

**Climb up the stairs by the fountain and continue along the top of the rampart about five minutes to reach the harborfront site of the overrated, overfondled, and overphotographed symbol of Copenhagen, Den Lille Havfrue, or...**

## 22. The Little Mermaid

The Little Mermaid statue was a gift to the city of Copenhagen in 1909 from brewing magnate Carl Jacobsen (whose art collection forms the basis of the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek). Inspired by a ballet performance of Andersen's story, Jacobsen hired the young sculptor Edvard Eriksen to immortalize the mermaid as a statue. Eriksen used his wife Eline as the model. The statue sat unappreciated for 40 years until Danny Kaye sang "Wonderful Copenhagen" in the 1952 movie Hans Christian Andersen, and the tourist board decided to use the mermaid as a marketing symbol for the city. For the non-Disneyfied Little Mermaid story—and insights into Hans Christian Andersen—see the sidebar.

**This is the end of our extended wonderful, wonderful Copenhagen City Walk. From here you can get back downtown on foot, by taxi, or on bus #27 (catch it along Indiakaj, a two-minute walk north).**
