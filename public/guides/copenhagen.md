## 1. Rådhuspladsen (City Hall Square)

Start from **Rådhuspladsen**, the bustling heart of Copenhagen, dominated by the tower of the City Hall. For 700 years, Copenhagen was contained within its city walls, and this square was its fortified west end. By the mid-1800s, **140,000 people were packed inside**. The overcrowding led to hygiene problems. (A cholera outbreak killed 5,000.) It was clear: The walls needed to come down...and they did. Those formidable town walls survive today only in echoes—a circular series of roads and the remnants of moats, which are now **people-friendly city lakes**.

Rådhuspladsen is today, along with its convenient Metro station, the place where the city gathers to celebrate.

**Rådhuspladsen Spin-Tour:** Stand **50 yards in front of City Hall** and turn clockwise. Old **Hans Christian Andersen** sits to the right of City Hall.

## 2. Tivoli Gardens

H. C. is looking at **Tivoli Gardens** (across the street). Tivoli Gardens was founded in **1843**, when magazine publisher Georg Carstensen convinced the king to build a pleasure garden outside the walls of crowded Copenhagen. The king believed happy people would care less about fighting for democracy. Tivoli became **Europe's first great public amusement park**.

The big, glassy building with the *DI* sign is filled with the offices of Danish Industry—a collection of Danish companies whose logos you can see in the windows.

---

## 3. Weather Girls

The big, broad boulevard is **Vesterbrogade** ("Western Way"), which led to the western gate of the medieval city (behind you, where the pedestrian boulevard begins). Here, in the traffic hub of this huge city, you'll notice...not many cars. Throughout Copenhagen, you'll see how the mayor's mantra, **"We will build a city not for cars but for people"**—along with tax-and-regulation policies that encourage small electric cars and use of public transit and bikes—is shaping the city.

Down Vesterbrogade towers the **Radisson Blu Royal Hotel** (with its SAS sign), once Copenhagen's only skyscraper. When it was built in 1960, Copenhageners took one look and decided—that's enough of a skyline. Notice there are no other buildings taller than the five-story limit in the old center.

The golden **weather girls** (on the corner, high above Vesterbrogade) indicate the weather: on a bike (fair weather) or with an umbrella (foul).

As you spin farther right, **three fast-food joints** stand at the entry to the Strøget, Copenhagen's grand pedestrian boulevard—where we're heading next.

Just beyond that and the Art Deco-style Palace Hotel (with a tower to serve as a sister to the City Hall) is the **Lur Blowers sculpture**, which honors the earliest warrior Danes. The *lur* is a curvy, trombone-sounding horn perhaps used to call soldiers to battle or to accompany pagan religious processions.

Down the street, on the left side of City Hall, the **Rainbow Square** is a reminder that in 1989 Denmark was the first country in the world to give legal rights to same-sex partnerships and has long been a leader in gay rights.

*Now head down the pedestrian boulevard (pickpocket alert).*

---

## 4. The Strøget

The American trio of Burger King, 7-Eleven, and KFC marks the start of this touristy pedestrian street. Finished in **1962**, Copenhagen's experimental, tremendously successful, and much-copied **pedestrian shopping mall** is a string of lively (and individually named) streets and squares that bunny-hop through the old town from City Hall to the Nyhavn quarter, a **20-minute stroll**.

*Walk one block (at Kattesundet), make a side trip three blocks left, straight into Copenhagen's colorful university district (Latin Quarter).*

---

## 5. St. Peter's Church (Sankt Petri Kirke)

You can also pass funky shops and the big brick **St. Peter's Church** (Sankt Petri Kirke)—the old **German merchant community's church**, which still holds services in German. Its fine **17th-century brick funerary chapel** (filling a ground-floor building out of the soil) is filled with fancy German tombs (church and burial chapels typically open to visitors Thu-Sat 11:00-15:00).

---

## 6. Cathedral of Our Lady (Vor Frue Kirke)

The obelisk-like **Reformation Memorial** across the street from the cathedral celebrates Denmark's break from the Roman Catholic Church to become Lutheran in **1536**. King Christian III presided over the council meeting when they decided to break away from Rome. Because of the reforms of 1536, there's **no Mary** in the Cathedral of Our Lady.

The church burned down in the **1807 British bombardment** of the city during the Napoleonic Wars. Rebuilt in the Neoclassical style, the cathedral's **façade looks like a Greek temple**. The interior is a **"world of Neoclassical serenity"**. The nave is lined by the **12 apostles**, clad in classical robes—masterpieces by the great Danish sculptor **Bertel Thorvaldsen**. They lead to a statue of the **Risen Christ**, standing where the statue of Zeus would have been.

---

## 7. Copenhagen University

Now home to nearly **40,000 students**, this university was founded by the king in the **15th century**. Today tuition is free.

---

## 8. Gammeltorv and Nytorv

**Gammeltorv** ("Old Square"), the town center, features the **Fountain of Charity (*Caritas*)** (early 1600s), which provided drinking water to locals since the early 1600s. Featuring a pregnant woman squirting water from her breasts next to a boy urinating, this was deemed too racy for people of the Victorian Age.

While **Gammeltorv** was the place of happiness and merriment, **Nytorv** ("New Square") was a place of severity and judgment. The square is **Neoclassical** (built mostly after the **1807 British bombardment**). Look down at the pavement and read the plaque: **"Here stood the town's *Kag* (whipping post) until 1780."**

---

## 9. Amagertorv

This square is prime real estate for talented street entertainers. Walk past the flagship **Lego store** (on right) to the stately brick **Holy Ghost Church (*Helligåndskirken*)**. The hospital nearby is an antiques hall.

---

## 10. Gråbrødretorv

Surrounded by fine old buildings, this leafy and beer-stained **"Grey Friars' Square"**—a monastic square until the Reformation made it a people's square—is popular for an outdoor meal or drink in the summer.

---

## 11. Stork Fountain Spin Tour

Two entries to underground, Victorian-era WCs are in front of the fountain (free, staffed, and delightful). The street ahead, a bit to the left, is **Østergade** (the fanciest shopping street in town). Farther around are three shopping institutions: **Georg Jensen** (luxury Danish design), **Royal Copenhagen** (with three floors of porcelain), and **Illums Bolighus** (department store offering modern Danish design).

---

## 12. Bishop Absalon Statue

Looking downhill from the fountain, about halfway to the imposing palace in the distance, you'll see a great man on a horse. Walk here to view this statue of Copenhagen's founder, **Bishop Absalon**, shown in his Warrior Absalon getup.

---

## 13. Christiansborg Palace and the Birthplace of Copenhagen

You're stepping onto the island of **Slotsholmen** ("Castle Island"), the easy-to-defend birthplace of Copenhagen in the **12th century**. It's dominated by the royal palace complex. **Christiansborg Palace** (with its **"three crowns" spire**)—the former residence of kings—is now the parliament building.

Ahead of you, the Neoclassical Lutheran church with the low dome is the **Christiansborg Palace Chapel**, site of 350 years of royal weddings and funerals (free, open daily 10:00-18:00 in July, otherwise open only Sun until 17:00, closed Mon-Sat).

This page, the seat of Danish government today, is considered the **birthplace of Copenhagen**. This is **Denmark's power island**, with the **Folketinget** (Danish parliament), Supreme Court, Ministry of Finance (to the left), and the **Børsen**—the historic stock exchange (farther to the left, with the fanciful dragon-tail spire).

---

## 14. Frederik VII Statue

Walk to the green copper equestrian statue. **Frederik VII** was crowned in 1848, just months before signing **Denmark's first constitution on June 5, 1849**.

---

## 15. Børsen (Stock Exchange)

The eye-catching **red-brick stock exchange** (not open to tourists) was inspired by the Dutch Renaissance. Built to promote the mercantile ambitions of Denmark in the 1600s, it was the **"World Trade Center" of Scandinavia**. Its **dragon-tail spire with three crowns** represents the Danish aspiration to rule a united Scandinavia—or at least be its commercial capital.

---

## 16. Havnegade Promenade

The **Havnegade promenade** to Nyhavn is a delightful people zone with **trampolines** (stop for a bounce), an ice-cream-licking ambience, and **harborview benches**.

---

## 17. Inderhavnsbroen Sliding Bridge ("Kissing Bridge")

From here, stroll several more blocks toward the **Inderhavnsbroen sliding bridge** for pedestrians and bikes. This **"kissing bridge"** is called that because the two sliding, or retractable, sections "kiss" when they come together. It links the town center with Christianshavn and makes the modern **Opera House** (ahead on the right, across the water) more accessible.

---

## 18. View of Nyhavn

Established in the 1670s along with Kongens Nytorv, **Nyhavn** ("New Harbor") is a recently gentrified sailors' quarter. The canal is filled with glamorous old sailboats of all sizes. Historic old sloops are welcome to moor here in Copenhagen's ever-changing boat museum. **Hans Christian Andersen lived and wrote his first stories here** (in the red double-gabled building at #20).

---

## 19. Kongens Nytorv ("King's New Square")

The "King's New Square" is home to the **Royal Theater**, the French embassy, and the **Hotel d'Angleterre**, where VIPs and pop stars stay. The square sits atop a major Metro station. In past winters, this square was a popular ice-skating rink. The **equestrian statue of Christian V** in the middle of the square celebrates Christian V, who made this square the city's geographical and cultural center.

---

## 20. Hviids Vinstue

The town's **oldest wine cellar (from 1723)**. It has a dark and woody interior and fascinating old Copenhagen photos. It's a colorful spot for an **open-face sandwich and a beer** (three sandwiches and a beer for 90 DKK at lunchtime, sandwiches only as long as they last, daily 10:00-14:00). Their wintertime *gløgg* (hot spiced wine) is legendary.

---

## Walk Extension: Nyhavn to Amalienborg

### 21. Amalienborg Palace and Square

Stroll along the canal to the Royal Danish Theatre's Playhouse and head left along the harborfront to a large plaza dotted with outdoor cafés and benches and views across the harbor. The striking **Opera House** is bigger than it looks—of its 14 floors, five are below sea level.

Queen Margrethe II, who abdicated the throne in 2024, lives in the mansion to your immediate left as you enter the square from the harborside. The mansion across the street (on the right as you enter) is where her son, **King Frederik X**, lives with his wife **Queen Mary**—an Australian businesswoman—and their four children.

The **guards change daily at noon**. The equestrian statue of **Frederik V** is a reminder that this square was the centerpiece of a planned town he envisioned in 1750.

Just inland, the striking **Marble Church (*Marmorkirken*)** was designed to fit this ritzy new quarter.

---

### 22. To The Little Mermaid (*Den Lille Havfrue*)

Walk toward **Kastellet Park**. The **1908 Gefion Fountain** illustrates the myth of the goddess Gefion carving a hunk out of Sweden to make into Denmark's main island, Sjælland.

Climb up the stairs by the fountain and continue along the top of the rampart about five minutes to reach the harborfront site of the overrated, overfondled, and overphotographed symbol of Copenhagen, *Den Lille Havfrue*.

**The Little Mermaid** statue was a gift to the city of Copenhagen in 1909 from brewing magnate Carl Jacobsen. Inspired by a ballet performance of Andersen's story, Jacobsen hired the young sculptor **Edvard Eriksen** to immortalize the mermaid as a statue. Eriksen used his wife **Eline as the model**. The statue sat unappreciated for 40 years until Danny Kaye sang "Wonderful Copenhagen" in the **1952 movie *Hans Christian Andersen***, and the tourist board decided to use the mermaid as a marketing symbol for the city.
