Dominated by the New Town Hall with its famous Glockenspiel, this magnificent Gothic Revival building was constructed between 1867 and 1909. The Glockenspiel performs daily at 11am and 12pm (also at 5pm from March to October), featuring 43 bells and 32 life-sized figures that reenact historical Bavarian events. The square has been the focal point of Munich since the Middle Ages, serving as a marketplace and center of public life. Today it remains the heart of the pedestrian zone and a must-visit destination for tourists exploring Munich's rich history and culture.",
